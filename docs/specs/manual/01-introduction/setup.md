## COPY PROTECTION

### Save Your Serial Number

The first time you run Stars!, you will be asked to enter your unique serial number. The number is printed on 2 labels enclosed in the pack.

### It is very important that you keep the serial number where you can find it

later .

Stars! may ask for the number again if :

### One Computer - One Serial Number

Each computer running Stars! must use a unique serial number. Given this, the copy protection activates ONLY in the following situations: - When players using the same serial number submit turns created on two different computers . This includes submitting turns from networked computers sharing a serial number. If you want to submit turns from different machines on a network, each of those machines must have a - One person submits turns for two or more player positions from different computers that share the same Stars! serial number .


In every case, Stars! will give you a chance to enter a unique serial number

### How the Copy Protection Works

Stars! is played by submitting player log files to the host (either a human or the game itself). Each log file is tagged with the serial number for the copy of Stars! used to generate the file, and a fingerprint of the computer on which the game was installed. If the Stars! host receives two or more log files with different computer fingerprints and the same serial number it assumes that all the players associated with those log files are guilty of software piracy, and activates the copy protection for those players (honest players are unaffected). The copy protection makes the game unplayable for the guilty parties, until each player enters a unique serial number. As soon as each player submits turns with a unique serial number, the copy protection deactivates.

The Host Doesn’t Need a Serial Number

### A host can use the same serial number as one other player without affecting

the host or the player. This allows you to host and play from the same copy of

### Stars!

If you are running some combination of Windows 95, NT or 3.x on a single computer you will be asked for a serial number the first time you run Stars! under each version of Windows. After that, you should only be bothered for the number if you change your system configuration or delete the stars.ini file from the Windows directory. Each version of Windows will have its own directory containing Windows system software. By default, this directory is named Windows. You may have named it something different on your system.
