## RACE CREATION

In Stars! there are no superior races, there are only superior styles of play . Learn your race’s strengths and weaknesses. Test them against a variety of opponents and universe configurations. Start with small games and work

20 DESIGNING CUSTOM RACES

The Custom Race wizard allows you to create, save and edit your player races. Here, you define a race’s strengths and weaknesses. The trick lies in balancing advantages with disadvantages in order to achieve a mix that makes the best use of the stuff of creation — units of primordial ooze called

## OPENING THE WIZARD

You can open the Custom Race wizard using the File (Custom Race wizard ) menu item, or from the basic or advanced new game dialogs. Alternately, you can open an existing race for editing using the File (Open) menu item and

## ADVANTAGE POINTS

In each step, the box in the upper right corner of the dialog shows the current

With each advantage selected, the number decreases. Advantage points go down a little for slight advantages, and a lot for juicy ones. Before you finish, attributes wisely. the number of advantage points must be greater than or equal to zero. When Creationville. To get back in the black, select a few disadvantages (one of the duration. You can catches of playing God).


STEP 1: BASIC RACE DEFINITION

### Race Name and Password

Name your race and if you wish, choose a password. The password chosen when a race is created is attached to the race file. While you may change the password during the game, that change applies only to the current game.

### Opening that race file for use in another game will require proper entry of the

original password. In order to view or edit the race file, you also need the

### Predefined Races

Selecting a predefined race automatically presets all of the options in steps 2 through 6. Choosing a predefined race doesn’t prevent you from changing any option — they are only provided as a time saver. Each predefined race has specific strengths and weaknesses you can use in determining your playing

### Use the Custom Race wizard to learn about the pre-selected attributes for

each predefined race and use a race as a starting point for one of your own: 2. Use the Back and Next buttons to step through the wizard, noting the 3. Go back to step 1 and select the predefined race that looked the best for Read more about 4. Fine tune that race using as much of the wizard as necessary.

### Other Basic Definition Options

You will get 10kT of surface minerals for each leftover advantage point. For example, if there are 20 unused points, you would receive a total of 200kT of minerals. Stars! weights the distribution in favor of the rarest minerals. These

You will get one additional mine for every two leftover advantage points. These will be available immediately.


You will get one additional factory for every 5 leftover advantage points. Choosing the These will be available immediately. You will get one additional defense installation for every 10 leftover advantage points. These will be available immediately.

Leftover Advantage Points – Mineral Concentration

### The concentration of the mineral on your home world that would have been

poorest is improved by 1% for every 3 leftover advantage points. Increasing the concentration increases the rate at which the mineral is mined (mining, of

### Race Emblem

Select a race emblem from the collection. This emblem identifies your fleets when they are displayed in the Selection Summary pane. In a multi-player game you may not get the emblem you select if another player chooses the

Choose the major characteristics for your race. Each primary trait gives you a specific and powerful set of strengths. This section lists of the specific technologies, advantages and disadvantages for each primary trait.

Specify/view the lesser traits for your race. You’ll probably find several traits that won’t affect your playing strategy. Each time you choose a trait that prevents you from developing something, you’ll gain advantage points you’ll be able to use elsewhere or, if you’re in the hole, bring the balance closer to being above zero (you have to be above or at zero before you can click on Finish).

Select lesser traits that compliment the profile you chose in step 2:

### Improved Fuel Efficiency trait

Your ships will burn 15% less fuel than what the drive specifications indicate. The Fuel Mizer and the Galaxy Scoop engines are also available. This trait also increases your starting tech in propulsion by one level.

### Total Terraforming trait

You begin the game with the ability to adjust each of a planet’s environment attributes by up to 3% in either direction. Throughout the game, additional terraforming technologies not available to other players will be achievable, up to 30% terraforming. Total Terraforming requires 30% fewer resources.

### Ultimate Recycling trait

When you scrap a fleet at a starbase, you recover 90% of the minerals and 70% of the resources used to produce the fleet. The resources are available for use the next year. Scrapping at a planet gives you 45% of the minerals and

These resources are not strictly additive. The number a planet receives is

(Current_production + Extra_resources)

This formula is true whether or not a planet has a starbase.

### Low Starting Population trait

Instead of 25000 people, you start with 17500 (30% fewer). It takes a long time to overcome a lower starting population — it helps to have a high

### Bleeding Edge Technology trait

New technologies initially cost twice as much to build. As soon as you exceed all of the tech requirements by one level, the cost drops back to normal. Miniaturization, the lowering of production costs, occurs at 5% per level, up to 80%. Without this trait miniaturization occurs at 4% and tops out

### Regenerating Shields trait

All shields are 40% stronger than the listed rating. Shields regenerate at 10% of the maximum strength after every round of battle. All armors are at 50% of

Specify your race’s habitable range and its growth rate under optimum

### Growth Conditions

Use this step to specify how well your race tolerates gravity, temperature and radiation. The tolerances are set individually for each of the three

The width of the colored bar represents the extent of the habitable range. The width plus the position of the bar left or right determine the extremes of the habitable range. The numbers to the right of the bar show the extremes in either gravities (g), degrees Celsius (C) or millirads (mR).

### Your race will grow only on planets with conditions that fall within the

habitable ranges. On planets that are outside the habitable ranges, some colonists will die every year due to the unbearable conditions.


The gravity and temperature of every planet are picked at random, but are slightly weighted to favor values in the middle of the spectrum. If you move the colored bar away from the center, the advantage points increase, compensating for the reduction in the number of habitable planets you will encounter. The radiation level of a planet is chosen completely at random.

### Adjusting the Habitable Range

If you click on or the entire range moves left or right. Holding down the SHIFT key while clicking moves the range in steps. Click and hold the

Clicking widens the habitable range. Clicking the habitable range. Holding down the SHIFT key while clicking narrows and widens the range in 20% increments.

### Choosing an Extreme Range

Cons: The more extreme your habitability range, the more planets will be out

Pros: You get back advantage points. Also, planets with environments near the ends of the spectrum have a good chance of being super-rich in one or more minerals. For example, a planet with a flesh-searing radiation extreme of 97mR could easily have four times the concentration of each mineral as a

### Immunity

Selecting the Immune to Radiation checkbox allows you to ignore an environmental factor. This is very expensive and will require the selection of many disadvantages to bring advantage points back above zero. When you select immunity, the habitable range becomes irrelevant and disappears. If you select any kind of immunity, you may not want to spend points on the Total Terraforming advantage. Once you’re in the game, you can research individual terraforming technologies that apply only to environmental factors that can affect you. If you are totally immune, you never need to terraform.

D ESI GN IN GCU STO M R ACE S 20-15

### Selecting immunity is different than expanding the habitable range to fill the

entire spectrum. Immunity treats every point in the spectrum as 100% ideal. A range widened to fill the spectrum treats only the mid-point as 100% ideal. The edges of the range are 0% ideal.

### Maximum Population Growth

Set the maximum colonist growth rate between 1% and 20% per year. The colonists will grow at this rate only if the habitability value is 100%. If the habitability value is less than 100%, the colonist growth rate will fall

For example:

If your people decide to colonize Demski, a rock with a habitability value of

displays this popup:

If you are immune to an environmental factor, every planet you explore will be 100% ideal for that factor. Immunity is expensive. You will have to choose many disadvantages in order to compensate and bring the advantage point

If you select both immunity and the advantage of Total Terraforming, some or all of the points used to obtain the Total Terraforming advantage will be

### Sample Strategies

If you have a race with a high population growth, you may not care about being efficient with factories. In this case you would set the controls so colonists produce fewer and more expensive factories, thereby freeing up

If you don’t plan on building a lot of mines, or if you have extra advantage points, consider increasing the mining production rate. This will NOT affect the rate at which the mineral concentration is reduced on your planets. It only makes you more efficient at squeezing minerals out of the rock. This can give you a competitive advantage over a player who operates more mines but is less efficient—they’ll decrease their mineral concentration faster than you. The rate at which mineral concentration decreases (always stopping at 1) is determined by the number of mines on a planet and the number of years

### Keep in mind that when the mineral concentrations on both your planets and

your opponent’s planets reaches 1, the player with more mines can do as well, and possibly better, than the player who is very efficient at extraction. If you’re very good at production and are creating resources like crazy, you may find you can easily make up for low mineral concentrations with Mineral Alchemy.


These are only simple examples of possible strategies—make the choices that suit your game the best, keeping in mind the rules determining the rate at

Next you’ll specify the cost of research for your race.
