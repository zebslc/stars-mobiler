## POPULATION AND GROWTH

Alternate Reality races are highly developed energy-based life forms. Their
bodies are fragile, flattening like paper under any but the lightest gravitational
conditions. As a result they have adapted to living in starbases instead, controlling their planets from orbit. Their growth rates are still determined by
the planet’s value as these numbers indicate their tolerance to such factors as
solar radiation and planetary gravity wells. Their maximum population per
planet is determined by the starbase size. This ranges from 250,000 for starter
colonies to 3,000,000 for their Death Star. Living on the starbase has a
downside: if the starbase is destroyed, the population goes with it.

## SCANNERS

Alternate Reality colonists perform scanning duty from the starbase. They
distance they scan is determined by the following formula:
Scanning Distance = SQRT(Population / 10)

### The Ultra Station and Death Star come with equipment that allows the

colonists to also perform penetrating scans at half that distance as long as you
don’t select the No Advanced Scanners trait when defining the race.

## MINING

These folks can’t build mines. Using energy powers alone, they can do a
limited amount of mining equal to this formula:
Mining = SQRT(Population/10)
However, since they don’t actually inhabit the planet, there is nothing to stop
them from remote mining worlds they own as well as uncolonized worlds.

## DEFENSES

Likewise, they can’t build defenses. Since they live and die with their starbase, defenses don’t have any meaning to them. People can’t bomb Alternate
Reality planets, and mineral packets flung from other planets don’t kill
Alternate Reality colonists.
The best defenses are advanced armor and weapons for the starbases, and
minefields.

## STARBASES

Starbases costs Alternators 20% less than other races (though this is not
cumulative with advantages provided by the Improved Starbases trait). They
are also able to build the Death Star, the biggest, baddest thing in the sky.

## COLONIZATION

Alternators can’t build normal colonization modules. They must build the
more expensive Orbital Colonization modules capable of deploying as an
Orbital Fort at the target world. This module can be mounted only on the
colonizer hull. The hull is also capable of limited bombing to get rid of any
pesky enemy startup colonies. An Orbital Colonization module can kill 2000
enemy colonists each year that it bombs.
There is a cost for traveling to other worlds. Interstellar travel kills 3% of any
colonists in the fleet per year.
Alternators cannot drop colonists on worlds in order to take them over (no
ground combat).
