## HUMANOIDS

Thin skin, rudimentary senses, efficient fat storage capabilities.

### Social Traits

Over promoted. The absolute average race, with no special abilities or disabilities. Can swing either way, playing a defensive game that focuses on outgrowing and outproducing opponents, or an offensive game that focuses

Has the potential to do well in any size of universe.

### Disadvantages

They have no serious advantages, either. And they’re dull.

### Strategies

Try to determine the attributes of your opponents and adjust to counter them. You can adapt to compete against almost any kind of opponent.

### Advantages

Immune to temperature. Good fighters, with top of the line warships and superior battle initiative. Cheap research for energy and weapons. Better than average with factories. Able to build cheaper starbases. Shields regenerate

### Disadvantages

Need to find planets with gravity and radiation on the further ends of the spectrum. Limited to a few types of armor and even those are at fi strength. Engine technology is sometimes unreliable. Has no chance to build freighter transport routes cheaply. Terraforming research is expensive.

### Strategies

Your best chance is probably to out-produce and aggressively attack your opponents. Build fast warships and colonizers. You colonize slowly so build remote miners and search for nearby planets with plentiful mineral contents. Be aggressive with your neighbors, and their neighbors: what you can’t

## NUCLEOTIDS

Has the potential to do well in any size of universe.

### Advantages

None of the other pre-made races grow faster (only the humanoids come close). Wide habitability range, as well as the ability to eventually terraform each environmental variable up to 30% makes proliferation highly likely. Although you are average at how many resources you create per person, your high growth rate will help increase the rate at which you create resources.

They are efficient with factories and terraforming planets. They start with Tech 5 in propulsion and construction giving them high speed engines and advanced hulls at the start of the game. In larger games their superior stargate

### Disadvantages

Slightly below average miners. Unable to build penetrating scanners.

### Strategies

Breed, breed, breed. With your habitable range, and terraforming advantages, you can inhabit a large portion of the universe.

## SILICANOIDS

### Physical Traits

Silicanoids resemble slow moving stacks of thousands of intricately oriented quartz scales that randomly shift and slide past one another as they submerge and surface within the body. When hurrying, Silicanoids produce a sound like metal rakes being drawn over rusted metal and leave a prismatic cloud of

### Social Traits

Abrasive by nature, immune to all environmental factors, can populate any planet, slow growing, slow to research. Planets are a common commodity for this race. If you lose a few, it won’t matter, because you can live anywhere.

### Disadvantages

Low growth rate, which means you can’t colonize at too fast of a rate. Poor

### Strategies

Don’t waste your time on scouts. Build mini-colony ships, fill them up, and colonize all the planets you find (make sure to colonize the more mineral-rich planets first). Don’t pull people off planets faster than you can grow them, though. Otherwise you’ll have thinly populated worlds ripe for takeover.

If the universe is large, you’ll have many planets colonized by the time you

No need for remote mining, since you can colonize anything.

Auto-build factories, then mines, then factories, until you find a better

Build starbases whenever you have enough resources.

Build big bombers to clear your opponent’s planets.

Build defensive fleets and park them near your starbases, holding off bombing
