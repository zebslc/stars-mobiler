Each computer running Stars! must use a unique serial number. Given this, the copy protection activates ONLY in the following situations:
- When you cancel the serial number dialog .
- When players using the same serial number submit turns created on two
different computers . This includes submitting turns from networked
computers sharing a serial number. If you want to submit turns from
different machines on a network, each of those machines must have a
copy of Stars! installed with a unique serial number.
- One person submits turns for two or more player positions from
different computers that share the same Stars! serial number .

In every case, Stars! will give you a chance to enter a unique serial number
and continue play normally.

### How the Copy Protection Works

Stars! is played by submitting player log files to the host (either a human or
the game itself). Each log file is tagged with the serial number for the copy of
Stars! used to generate the file, and a fingerprint of the computer on which
the game was installed. If the Stars! host receives two or more log files with
different computer fingerprints and the same serial number it assumes that all
the players associated with those log files are guilty of software piracy, and
activates the copy protection for those players (honest players are unaffected).
The copy protection makes the game unplayable for the guilty parties, until
each player enters a unique serial number. As soon as each player submits
turns with a unique serial number, the copy protection deactivates.

The Host Doesn’t Need a Serial Number

### A host can use the same serial number as one other player without affecting

the host or the player. This allows you to host and play from the same copy of

### Stars!

Computers Running More than One Version of Windows
If you are running some combination of Windows 95, NT or 3.x on a single
computer you will be asked for a serial number the first time you run Stars!
under each version of Windows. After that, you should only be bothered for
the number if you change your system configuration or delete the stars.ini file
from the Windows directory. Each version of Windows will have its own
directory containing Windows system software. By default, this directory is
named Windows. You may have named it something different on your system.

### Fleet Waypoints tile

The Fleet Waypoints tile lists all the waypoints assigned the
fleet under command. The first waypoint listed is the current
location. If the fleet are in transit between waypoints, the
location is given as coordinates in deep space.

### Right-click on the blue diamond to display a list of items at the

same location as the selected waypoint. Select an alternate
item to change the exact waypoint target.

Warp Factor: By default, Stars! chooses the ideal speed for
reaching the next waypoint with the fuel available. To
manually set the speed select the waypoint from the list, then
left-click and drag in the Warp gauge.
To use a stargate, drag the bar all the way to the right. If you’re
not at a stargate, the travel time will display Never.
Fuel Usage: This tells you exactly how much fuel the fleet will
use to reach the waypoint at its current speed. The number
turns red if you can’t reach the waypoint given the current
speed and fuel supply.
Repeat Orders: Repeats the total set of orders you assigned
using the Waypoints Task tile. Assigning repeat orders works
best when the first waypoint in the list is repeated as the last.

### Waypoint Task tile

This tile shows the task the fleet must perform at that waypoint
selected in the Fleet Waypoints tile. Click on the dropdown to
assign a task.

THE STARS! SCREEN 5-7

### Transport tasks

Use this task to load or unload minerals, fuel or colonists.
The middle dropdown lists methods of loading and unloading.
When you assign a load/unload action, the cargo name turns
from black to green. Some load/unload actions allow you to
specify exact amounts.

Zip Orders: To quickly load fuel, minerals and colonists, right-click on the blue diamond and choose a
pre-defined order from the list. If a Zip Order doesn’t quite meet your needs, you can create your own or
modify the existing order.
Load / Unload Actions:
(no action)              No transport task for the specified cargo.

Load All Available       Load as much of the specified cargo as the fleet can hold.

Unload All               Unload all the specified cargo at the waypoint.
Load Exactly...          Load the amount specified only if there is room in the hold.
Unload Exactly...        Unload the amount specified only if the fleet is carrying that amount.
Fill up to %...          Loads up to the specified portion of the cargo hold subject to amount available at
waypoint and room left in hold.
Wait for %...            Remain at the waypoint until exactly X % of the hold is filled.
Load Optimal             (fuel only) Load or unload fuel until the fleet carries only the exact amount needed to
reach the next waypoint. You can use this task to send a fleet loaded with fuel to
rescue a stranded fleet. The rescue fleet will transfer only the amount of fuel it can
spare without stranding itself.
Load Dunnage             (minerals and colonists only) This command waits until all other loads and unloads are
complete, then loads as many colonists or amount of a mineral as will fit in the
remaining space. For example, setting Load All Germanium, Load Dunnage Ironium, will load all the Germanium that is available, then as much Ironium as possible. If
more than one dunnage cargo is specified, they are loaded in the order of Ironium, Boranium, Germanium, and Colonists.

Set Amount to...         Load or unload the cargo until the amount on board is the amount specified. If less
than the specified cargo is available, the fleet will not move on.

Set Waypoint to...       Load or unload the cargo until the amount at the waypoint is the amount specified.
This order is always carried out to the best of the fleet’s ability that turn but does not
prevent the fleet from moving on.

### Colonize

Use this task to transport colonists to an unpopulated planet.
The fleet must contain a ship with a colonization module, and
must be loaded with colonists. Once the colony is established
you can use freighters to transport additional colonists.

### Remote Mining

Use this task to mine an uninhabited planet. The fleet must
have robot miners. The quantity of each mineral the fleet can
mine annually is shown by tonnage and color.
Blue: Ironiumm
Green: Boraniumm
Yellow: Germanium

### Merge with Fleet

Use this task to merge the fleet under command with a fleet at
the waypoint. The fleet given this task will be assimilated into
the target fleet and assume its orders.
To pick from multiple fleets at the waypoint, right-click on the
blue diamond in the Fleet Waypoints tile. Otherwise, Stars!
will pick the most dormant fleet with similar ships.

### Scrap Fleet

Use this task to salvage a portion of the minerals in the hulls
of outdated or unrecoverable ships. Players can also trade
technological knowledge by scrapping ships at each other’s
planets.

### The minerals are deposited on the planet where the fleet is

scrapped. The percentage of minerals recovered varies
depending on the situation.

THE STARS! SCREEN 5-9

### Lay Mine Fields

Use this task to lay mines at the waypoint. Fleets given this
task must have mine layers. The tile notes how many mines
the fleet will lay for each year it performs the task.

### Patrol

Use this task to intercept incoming enemy fleets. Set the
detection range to specify how far away the patrol ship will
look for interlopers. Manually select an intercept speed, or use
the default of Automatic intercept in the shortest possible time
using the least amount of fuel.

### Route

Use the Route task to automatically send fleets from one
planet to another. If the waypoint planet has a routing
destination, the fleet assigned this task will automatically set
that destination as its next waypoint.
Route destinations are set using the Production tile.

### Transfer Fleet

Use this task to place one of your fleets under the command
of another player, and to give that player knowledge of the
design of all ships in that fleet.

### This task will fail if the receiving player does not have enough

free ship design slots.

### Bringing a Fleet or Planet into the Command pane

Stars! provides more than one way to command a planet or fleet. Use the method that suits your
needs.

To command the planet you are orbiting, click on Goto in the
Location tile. (The planet must already belong to you.)

From the Command pane, you can select one of your fleets in
the same location using the Fleets in Orbit tile. Just choose a
fleet from the dropdown list and click on Goto.

You can also use the Scanner pane to bring either a planet or fleet into the Command pane. If the
object you wish to command is the only thing at that location, just double-click on it in the
Scanner.
When more than one object is in the same location, do one of the following:
- Right-click on the location, then click on the name of the object from the pop-up list.
- Left-click on the location till the object you wish to command appears in the Command pane.
When clicking on a location to cycle through your planet and fleets, other player’s fleets are
skipped. Even though you’d like to, you can’t display these fleets in the Command pane. Other
player’s fleets, if present, are listed in the pop-up: selecting one will display what you know about
that fleet in the Selection Summary pane.

Choosing Your View of the Universe
There are six exclusive scanner views, which you can use with one or more overlays. Use the
toolbar above the scanner to select views and overlays. Display or hide the toolbar with the View
(Toolbar) menu item.

### Normal view

This default scanner view displays the essentials, such as planets, fleets
positions, orbital devices, salvage sites, wormholes.

THE STARS! SCREEN 5-13

### Surface Minerals

This view displays the quantity of minerals under the surface at each
planet you own or have scanned. The mineral colors and scale
matches the display in the Summary pane’s mineral content graph.
Rescaling that graph rescales the bars in this view.

### Mineral Concentration

This view displays the concentration of minerals under the surface at
each planet you own or have scanned. The mineral colors and scale
matches the display in the Summary pane’s mineral content graph.
Rescaling that graph rescales the bars in this view.

### Planet Value

This view uses color and size to display which planets are best suited
to your race. Blue flags mark your planets, yellow flags mark your
friends’ planets and red flags mark planets of neutrals and enemies.
Planets without flags are uninhabited.
Green: habitable. The larger the circle, the more hospitable the
planet.
Yellow: habitable after terraforming. Larger circles indicate faster
minimal terraforming and better results.
Red:    uninhabitable. The larger the circle, the harsher the planet.

### Population

This view displays population levels. The wider the circle, the larger
the population. Planets are sorted by color:
Green: your colonized planets
Yellow: friends
Red:    enemies and neutrals
Uncolonized planets that you’ve visited are small and grey.

5-14    T HE STA RS ! SC R EE N

### No Player Information

This view hides all traces of planet ownership. Just a thousand dim points of light.

### Add Waypoints Mode

You can add waypoints for the fleet under command using just the mouse. This mode is primarily
for beginning players, or anyone who wants to eat and play at the same time.

### Scanner Coverage overlay

This overlay displays the effectiveness of radar coverage at the
percentage selected in the dropdown. Reducing the displayed
coverage does not change the actual coverage—it only gives you an
idea of what your coverage would be in relation to the cloaking ability
of opponents’ ships. For example, select 75% to show how close a
fleet with 25% cloaking will need to be before you can detect it.

### Mine Fields overlay

This overlay displays minefields as colored grids. Your minefields are
blue, friends are yellow, and enemies and neutrals are red.
You can see both the center and radius of another player’s minefield
only if either the center of the mine field is in range of your
penetrating scanner, or you have hit the minefield at least once and
the center is in range of your normal scanners or you are currently in
the minefield.

### Fleet Paths overlay

This overlay displays the assigned paths of all your fleets.

THE STARS! SCREEN 5-15

### Planet Names overlay

This overlay displays planet names in the scanner. If the names are too
crowded, increase the scanner zoom factor to place more distance
between planets. If Player Colors is activated, planet names appear in
the color assigned to that player. Your planet names always appear in
white.

### Ship Count overlay

This overlay displays the number of ships at a location. Active Ship

### Design and Enemy Ship Class filters will limit the count to ships

specified in those filters. For example, if you have a filter that displays
only enemy warships, the number above enemy fleets and planets will
be the count of only warships.
If Player Colors are turned on, numbers appear in the color assigned
to that player. Your fleet numbers always appear in white.

### Idle Fleets filter

Idle fleets are fleets with no movement orders. This overlay displays only your idle fleets and any
active enemy fleets. Only those planets with idle fleets in orbit will show orbit rings. Fleets that
have run out of fuel are still considered active, and won’t appear if you’re using only this overlay.
Exception: Claim Adjuster fleets that are terraforming from orbit are not considered idle.

### Ship Design filter

This overlay displays only those fleets that contain a specific ship design. Only those planets
orbited by the selected ships will have orbit rings.

### Enemy Ship Class filter

This overlay displays opponent fleets containing a specific selected ship class. Opponents’fleets
appears as red triangles. Only opponents’ planets orbited by the selected ships will have orbit
rings.
