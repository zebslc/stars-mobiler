mines will be built, and the minerals within will be mined and made available immediately to the locals. 1. Shift-click in the Scanner on the planet where you will build mines. 3. In the Production dialog, Add either Mine or Mines (Auto-build).

### Adding Items to the

To determine how much more of a mineral a new mine will produce: see how efficient your race is at building and using mines and factories. Cancel when you’ve finished.

2. Look at the mineral concentration information in the Selection Summary pane and the Minerals on Hand tile. Click on the mineral name or value in either of these locations to display information on the density of each

potential productivity, mineral concentration = actual productivity

For example, you learn from the View Race dialog that 10 mines produce up to 10 kT per year, and from the Mineral Content graph in the Selection Summary that Germanium concentration is 50. This means 100 mines will produce 50 kT of Germanium in the next year. In this case, you would have to add two mines for every additional kT of Germanium you

## CALCULATING THE RATE OF DECREASE IN MINERAL

### CONCENTRATION

The decrease in mineral concentration is related solely to the number of mines operating on a planet and the number of years the mines have been in operation. For two players with the same number of mines operating over the same number of years, the decrease in concentration will be the same for

Think about it in terms of Mine years: One Mine year means the operation of one mine on a planet in a year. If you are operating 50 mines per year on a

mineral’s concentration by one, divide 12,500 by the current mineral concentration.


## MINERAL CONCENTRATION AND MINING EFFICIENCY

efficient a player is at mining. When the concentration reaches 1 both on less efficient at mining can extract as many kTs as a very efficient player the mine is at

### REMOTE MINING the View Race

from uninhabited planets for transfer to your needy, inhabited worlds. You can only perform remote mining on uninhabited worlds, using mining ships that carry robot mining modules. You Mining

The freighter typically will be able to carry category for the 2. Assign the planet to be mined as the waypoint, with orders to carry out

3. When the fleet reaches the planet to be mined, split the miners and freighters back into separate fleets. 4. Select the freighter fleet and assign a circuitous route with waypoints at the planet(s) to receive the minerals, ending with the mining fleet as the last waypoint. At the mining fleet waypoint assign a transport order that

### Joint Ventures in Remote Mining

You can join with other players to remote mine a planet, each player using their own remote mining fleet and freighters or, since minerals can be transferred between different players fleets and planets, one player may mine then manually transfer the minerals to the other player’s holds for transports to

Any Super Stealth race can automate transferring cargo from another player’s mining fleet as a waypoint task—if the other player agrees, it’s diplomacy;

14 TRANSPORTING FREIGHT

You can transport minerals, fuel and colonists from waypoint to waypoint. For a description of These waypoints can be either planets or fleets. Freight is either carried in different cargo ships that have cargo holds or cargo pods, or flung across space using mass modules and mass drivers.
