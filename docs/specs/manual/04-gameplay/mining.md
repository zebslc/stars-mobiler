2. Look at the mineral concentration information in the Selection Summary
pane and the Minerals on Hand tile. Click on the mineral name or value
in either of these locations to display information on the density of each
mineral under the surface.
3. Calculate productivity using this formula:

potential productivity, mineral concentration = actual productivity

For example, you learn from the View Race dialog that 10 mines produce
up to 10 kT per year, and from the Mineral Content graph in the Selection
Summary that Germanium concentration is 50. This means 100 mines
will produce 50 kT of Germanium in the next year. In this case, you
would have to add two mines for every additional kT of Germanium you
want each year.

## CALCULATING THE RATE OF DECREASE IN MINERAL

### CONCENTRATION

The decrease in mineral concentration is related solely to the number of
mines operating on a planet and the number of years the mines have been in
operation. For two players with the same number of mines operating over the
same number of years, the decrease in concentration will be the same for
each.

Think about it in terms of Mine years: One Mine year means the operation of
one mine on a planet in a year. If you are operating 50 mines per year on a
planet, that equates to 50 Mine years.

### Remote mining is the use of robot miners to remove minerals

from uninhabited planets for transfer to your needy, inhabited
worlds. You can only perform remote mining on uninhabited             Alternate Reality

the planet(s) to receive the minerals, ending with the mining fleet as the
last waypoint. At the mining fleet waypoint assign a transport order that

causes the minerals to be loaded from the miner to the freighter in the
most optimum way possible.

### When you set the mining fleet as the waypoint instead of the planet the

mining fleet is orbiting, the freighter will automatically follow the mining
fleet wherever you send it.

### Joint Ventures in Remote Mining

You can join with other players to remote mine a planet, each player using
their own remote mining fleet and freighters or, since minerals can be
transferred between different players fleets and planets, one player may mine
then manually transfer the minerals to the other player’s holds for transports to
the agreed upon ports-o-call.

Any Super Stealth race can automate transferring cargo from another player’s
mining fleet as a waypoint task—if the other player agrees, it’s diplomacy;
otherwise, it’s piracy.
