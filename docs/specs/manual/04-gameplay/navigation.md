## ADDING FLEET WAYPOINTS AND TASKS

To add a fleet waypoint and a task to accomplish at that waypoint:
1. Select the fleet into the Command pane. Just double-click on its location
in the Scanner, or right-click on it and choose the fleet from the pop-up
list.

### You can follow a fleet currently at your location by right-clicking on the

diamond in the Fleet Waypoints tile and selecting that fleet from the list.
This fleet appears as the waypoint.
2. SHIFT-click on the destination waypoint. This can be any planet, fleet or
other object or point in space. A green line appears between your current
location and the new waypoint.

### New waypoint

Current waypoint
Assign an appropriate task from the Waypoint Task tile. If there’s no work
to be done at that waypoint, choose No Task Here from the dropdown
list.
4. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to add more waypoints.

5. If the fleet to continually repeat the entire series of tasks until it is
interrupted, and if the final waypoint is the same as the starting waypoint, check Repeat Orders in the Waypoint Task tile.

## NOTES AND TIPS ON WAYPOINTS AND THE SCANNER

### Distance and the Scanner Grid

When you set a waypoint, notice that the Scanner snaps to an invisible grid.
The grid snap is one light year, and cannot be redefined. Vertical or horizontal
distance is measured in whole years. Diagonal distance between coordinates
is a decimal amount slightly larger than one light year. You can disable
snapping to objects by holding down the SHIFT key while dragging the cursor.

### Selecting One Object from Many at the Same Location

If there are multiple objects at the location, click on the blue diamond in the
Fleet Waypoints tile and select the object you wish to make the waypoint.

### White Fleet Paths

The fleet path appears in white if two or more legs of the route are identical;
for example, if you set a return path along the same route.

Don’t Choose the Same Waypoint Twice in a Row
You can’t add two consecutive waypoints at the same location.

## MOVING FLEET WAYPOINTS

### If you want to move a waypoint from one place to

another, move the cursor over the point you want to
move, and the cursor will change to a hand. Click the
mouse and the hand will close. Drag the mouse to the
new destination. You will notice that the destination
will snap to objects when you get close to them to
help you avoid missing a planet. If you want to set a waypoint close to an
object, but not at the object, hold down on the SHIFT key while dragging in
order to disable the snap-to-object behavior.

## DELETING FLEET WAYPOINTS

There are two ways to remove a waypoint:
- Click on the waypoint you want to remove, then press either the
Backspace or Delete key.
- Click on the waypoint, then drag it to the next or previous waypoint and
release.

## STARGATE NAVIGATION

### You must have a stargate at the source planet and at the               A stargate appears

destination planet. You can navigate using your stargates and          as a dark green dot

Friend’s stargates. Stargates have limitations both on the mass they
can transfer and the distance the mass is transferred.

To send a fleet through a stargate:
1. If necessary, bring the fleet to the planet with the stargate. Make sure the
fleet is carrying only Fuel. For all races except those based on the
Interstellar Traveler trait, cargo must be transferred to the planet or to
another fleet before using the stargate.
2. SHIFT-click on the destination planet (which much also have a stargate), selecting it as the next waypoint.
3. Click in the Warp Speed gauge, dragging to the end of the gauge. The
speed will change to Use Stargate . That’s it. On the next turn, your fleet
will appear at the destination planet, regardless of the distance traveled.

### Stargate Travel Time

1 Year – Travel is safe.

Uncertain – You don’t know anything about the planet or your data is old.
Your stargate will attempt to make the jump, but there is no guarantee there is
a gate at the other end.

Danger — your fleet will take damage in transit. The fleet is exceeding the
mass or distance limitation of one or both stargates.

Never – A stargate does not exist at one or both waypoints, or it exceeds by
greater than 5X the mass or distance limitation.

Range (how far fleets can jump safely)
Range is determined by the source stargate. To learn the range of a stargate,        mass limit

- Left-click on the Starbase tile, displaying the starbase schematic with the
included stargate. The range is the bottom number on the stargate picture.
range
If the source stargate belongs to a Friend, you’ll need to ask them about the
range.

### You may be able to exceed the normal range by up to five times the distance

and still arrive at the other gate. The fleet will, however, always take damage.
Keep this in mind, though: Anytime you exceed either the range or mass limit, there is a chance that the fleet will explode.

### Hull Mass Limitation

Most stargates have a safe hull mass limitation. Only ships that do not exceed
the safe mass limitation of both the source and destination stargates will arrive
safely. This is determined by the range of the source stargate. If your fleet will
exceed this limitation, Travel Time on the Fleet Waypoint tile will read
Danger.

To learn the mass limitation of a stargate, that belongs to you:
1. Select the planet into the Command pane.
2. Drag your cursor over the Starbase tile.
3. Left-click on the tile, displaying the starbase schematic with the included

stargate. The mass limit is the top number on the stargate.

If the source stargate belongs to a Friend, you’ll need to ask them about the
mass limitation.                                                                  Learn more about

## WORMHOLE NAVIGATION

### Wormholes are spacial anomalies that appear and disappear at

whim. There are several types, some more stable than others.

### Wormholes offer you free travel across huge distances of space

and have no limitations on ship or cargo mass.

Wormholes appear only in deep space, being somewhat repelled by the
gravity wells caused by a planet.

Wormhole stability ranges from Rock Solid to Very Unstable. Rock Solid
wormholes can stay in one general area for 30 years or more. Very Unstable
wormholes tend to move to a different area within about five years.

Each end of the wormhole moves independently. Due to their complex
nature, wormholes jiggle a bit every year. Their exact location is always
shifting.
- To navigate a wormhole, select it as a waypoint. Your fleet will enter the
wormhole as soon as it reaches the opening, and appear at the other end         Detecting

12               COLONIZATION

### Colonize planets that are immediately habitable by you or that have a

negative value but can be terraformed to become habitable. You should
colonize as many planets as possible in order to increase the rate at which
you gain resources, which you need to build better technology and more
fleets. At the same time, don’t pull people off your home world so fast that
you begin to lose significant resources. Try to find a balance between the
planet’s growth rate and the rate at which you send colonists off-planet.
