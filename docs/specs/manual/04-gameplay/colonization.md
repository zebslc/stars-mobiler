## CHOOSING PLANETS TO COLONIZE

Planets come in three basic flavors:

Planets you can inhabit immediately . These have a positive value, and appear
green in Planet Value view in the scanner. The better the planet, the higher
the value, and the larger the green dot. The higher the value, the faster your
colony will grow.

Planets that have a negative value but can be terraformed by you . These          Races based on the

they land.
Planets that will just plain kill you . These have a negative value, and appear
red in Planet Value view. The bigger the red dot, the more deadly the planet.
You don’t have the ability to terraform these planets, although if you can
increase your level of terraforming technology you may see that red dot           Learn about:

### Two items in the Selection Summary pane can also help you determine which

planets are good candidates for colonization:

## COLONIZING AN UNINHABITED PLANET

To colonize an uninhabited planet, you need a fleet containing at least one
ship with a colonization module as part of the hull design. Most races start
with at least one colonizer. If you don’t have any colony ships, add one or
more to your production queue.                                                      Learn about:

### Adding Items to the

1. Select the colony fleet, bringing it into the Command pane. You can do           Production Queue, this by double-clicking on its location in the Scanner, or, if more than one     p 7-2
object (such as a planet) is at the location, right-click and select the fleet
from the list.
2. In the Fuel and Cargo tile, click in the Cargo gauge and transfer colonists
from the planet into the fleet’s holds.
3. SHIFT-click in the Scanner on the destination planet.
4. In the Waypoint Task tile, select Colonize as a waypoint task.

The colonists will dismantle the colony ship when they land, using any
leftover cargo and some of the minerals used in the ship construction to help
start the colony.

It’s usually a good idea to minimize the number of ships in the colonization
fleet. Once the colony is established you can transport additional colonists
using a freighter (colonists are unloaded, and the freighter proceeds to its next
waypoint).

The colonization module is pictured in the margin. For a better picture, press
F2 to open the Technology Browser, then select the Mechanical category. To
learn which of your fleets has a colonization module:

1. Double-click on locations in the Scanner where your ships are present,           Module
starting logically with the location from where you will launch the
colonizing force. If a planet is also present, right-click on the location and
select a ship in the popup list.
2. Right-click in the Fleet Composition tile to display the hull schematic.
When a picture of the colonization module appears, you know you’ve
found your fleet.

Click on Next in the Fleet tile to display additional fleets.

## SHUTTLING COLONISTS WITH FREIGHTERS

You can use freighters to shuttle colonists to your established colonies. (If
you’re heading for a planet owned by an opponent, expect a fight, and be            You can create

Most of a planet’s minerals lay under the surface, unavailable for use until
your colonists mine them. You can build mines on your own worlds, or use
robot miners to mine uninhabited worlds.

### The mineral content and concentrations for a planet are shown in the

Selection Summary pane and the Minerals on Hand tile. The number of mines
that have been built and can be operated appear in the Minerals on Hand tile.
