## FIELDS OF STUDY

There are six fields of study: Energy, Weapons, Propulsion, Construction,
Electronics, and Biotechnology. You
can research only one at a time. The
levels of proficiency range from 0 to
26 (at 26, you are a techno-geek
summa cum astrolabe, a level that
20th century hi-tech moguls can only
daydream about reaching). When you
complete a research level, new
technology becomes available to you.

Going beyond the level needed to produce an item has cost benefits: for
every technology level you achieve above the required level, the production

cost of that item is reduced by 5%. You can eventually reduce the production
costs for many items by 75%. This is also referred to as miniaturization.

### The type of research needed to gain a technology depends on the function of

that technology. For example, most ship hulls require Construction research
only. Some technology requires research into more than one area: Gravity
Terraforming requires research in both Biotechnology and Propulsion.

### Use the Research dialog to specify a field of study and the percentage of

resources you wish to apply annually to that research. The dialog also
displays the specific technology you’ll gain by achieving the next few levels
in that field. Resources applied to research are taken off the top of your
resource heap. This allocation is modified only if you check Contribute Only
Leftover Resources to Research in the Production dialog, reversing the order
and allocating resources first to production, then research.

You can change research fields before achieving a new level. Stars! keeps
track of how much progress you’ve made in a field, allowing you to return to
a partially researched field at any time without losing progress.

### Choosing the Next Field of Study

Queue your next field of interest using the Next Field to Research dropdown
in the Research dialog. This switches your research as soon as you reach the
next level in your current field. All resources not needed to reach the next
level in your current field are applied to the next field.

If you achieve the maximum level for a field and forget to specify a new field, Stars! automatically selects the least researched field.

### BROWSING STARS! TECHNOLOGY

The Technology Browser provides details about every technology you can
learn through research, including ship components, planetary installations and
terraforming. To enter the Technology Browser, press F2 or choose the Help
(Technology Browser ) menu item.

Cost appears when you haven’t completely researched the technology
required to build the item. The color of each required research field tells you
whether you’ve completed the necessary level of research. Red indicates you
have more research to do, black indicates that you have reached the
necessary level. The number next to each field is the level to attain. The Cost
is the number of resources needed to build that item.

## ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH

### How Production Affects Research

For research, you receive all resources from planets with nothing in the
production queue and with auto-build turned off. You also receive all unspent
resources from planets with queues blocked by lack of minerals. If the

### Contribute Only Leftover Resources to Research box is selected in the

Production dialog, you’ll only receive the resources left over if the planet’s
queue is emptied that turn.

If this box is not selected, you’ll receive the percentage of resources you
indicated in the Research dialog, plus any resources left if the production
queue if emptied that turn. If the production queue is blocked you’ll receive
all the resources from that planet for that turn.

### Predicting How Much Time Research will Take

Predicting the amount of time it will take to complete a research level is
slightly tricky. Stars! displays the Estimated Time to Completion in the
Research dialog.

The estimate is based on an unchanging supply of resources, including the
following:
- all resources from planets with empty production queues and non-active
auto-build
- allocated resources from planet’s items in production but who are
dedicating resources to production first (Contribute Only Leftover
Resources to Research box is not selected).

R ESEAR CH         8-5

To get your best estimate of how long research will take, look at both the
current time estimate and the number of resources allocated the previous year
(also shown in the Research dialog). Each turn, check how much the estimate
changes as a result of changing conditions in your empire.

To get a more accurate estimate, assign or change your research allocation as
the last task of your turn. By then, Stars! will know how many resources are
required for production and will remove those from the calculation for
research time.

### Sample Strategies for Resource Allocation

Some people play Stars! with global research allocation set to a low number, assuming that on some turns production queues will run out of things to do
and large amounts of resources will be allocated automatically to research.
Other people like to keep their production queues busy all the time, and need
to allocate a larger research allocation up front. Both styles can be equally
successful.

## THE COST OF RESEARCH

Research becomes more expensive for each level of technology you achieve.
You spend resources to do research. Research in any field becomes
progressively more expensive, increasing in a Fibonacci type series. The total        Fibonacci numbers
cost equals the cost for that field plus the added cost of 10 resources per field     are the unending
sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, of study per level you’ve already achieved. This cost is calculated for you in

research only the field(s) needed for you to be able to gain that technology.
Then you’ll never use more resources than necessary to learn a technology.
Ultimately, though, it costs the same to research all technology. The added

costs encourage you to develop a few initial technologies quickly and take
them out into the universe.

9               SHIP AND STARBASE DESIGN

Use the Ship and Starbase Designer to create, edit and delete new ship and
starbase designs. Once you create a new ship design you can add it to the
production queue of any of your planets that has a starbase with a space
dock.

You don’t need a starbase to build a starbase. If your colony has the resources
and minerals, just add the starbase to the queue.
