## FIELDS OF STUDY

There are six fields of study: Energy, Weapons, Propulsion, Construction, technology becomes available to you.

Going beyond the level needed to produce an item has cost benefits: for every technology level you achieve above the required level, the production


cost of that item is reduced by 5%. You can eventually reduce the production costs for many items by 75%. This is also referred to as miniaturization.

### The type of research needed to gain a technology depends on the function of

that technology. For example, most ship hulls require Construction research only. Some technology requires research into more than one area: Gravity Terraforming requires research in both Biotechnology and Propulsion.

### Use the Research dialog to specify a field of study and the percentage of

resources you wish to apply annually to that research. The dialog also displays the specific technology you’ll gain by achieving the next few levels in that field. Resources applied to research are taken off the top of your resource heap. This allocation is modified only if you check Contribute Only Leftover Resources to Research in the Production dialog, reversing the order and allocating resources first to production, then research.

You can change research fields before achieving a new level. Stars! keeps track of how much progress you’ve made in a field, allowing you to return to a partially researched field at any time without losing progress.

### Choosing the Next Field of Study

Queue your next field of interest using the Next Field to Research dropdown in the Research dialog. This switches your research as soon as you reach the next level in your current field. All resources not needed to reach the next

If you achieve the maximum level for a field and forget to specify a new field, Stars! automatically selects the least researched field.

### BROWSING STARS! TECHNOLOGY

The Technology Browser provides details about every technology you can learn through research, including ship components, planetary installations and terraforming. To enter the Technology Browser, press F2 or choose the Help


category from the dropdown list

### Resource cost and weight

Technical

race trait requirements

Cost appears when you haven’t completely researched the technology required to build the item. The color of each required research field tells you whether you’ve completed the necessary level of research. Red indicates you have more research to do, black indicates that you have reached the necessary level. The number next to each field is the level to attain. The Cost

### The Technology Browser always displays cost and other information relative Learn more about

to your race type and current level of knowledge. The printed documentation and online help shows base costs without regard to race traits or current knowledge.


## ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH

### How Production Affects Research

For research, you receive all resources from planets with nothing in the production queue and with auto-build turned off. You also receive all unspent resources from planets with queues blocked by lack of minerals. If the

### Contribute Only Leftover Resources to Research box is selected in the

Production dialog, you’ll only receive the resources left over if the planet’s

If this box is not selected, you’ll receive the percentage of resources you indicated in the Research dialog, plus any resources left if the production queue if emptied that turn. If the production queue is blocked you’ll receive

### Predicting How Much Time Research will Take

Predicting the amount of time it will take to complete a research level is slightly tricky. Stars! displays the Estimated Time to Completion in the

The estimate is based on an unchanging supply of resources, including the - all resources from planets with empty production queues and non-active - allocated resources from planet’s items in production but who are dedicating resources to production first (Contribute Only Leftover Resources to Research box is not selected).


To get your best estimate of how long research will take, look at both the current time estimate and the number of resources allocated the previous year (also shown in the Research dialog). Each turn, check how much the estimate

To get a more accurate estimate, assign or change your research allocation as the last task of your turn. By then, Stars! will know how many resources are required for production and will remove those from the calculation for

### Sample Strategies for Resource Allocation

Some people play Stars! with global research allocation set to a low number, assuming that on some turns production queues will run out of things to do and large amounts of resources will be allocated automatically to research. Other people like to keep their production queues busy all the time, and need to allocate a larger research allocation up front. Both styles can be equally

## THE COST OF RESEARCH

Research becomes more expensive for each level of technology you achieve. You spend resources to do research. Research in any field becomes progressively more expensive, increasing in a Fibonacci type series. The total cost equals the cost for that field plus the added cost of 10 resources per field are the unending sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, of study per level you’ve already achieved. This cost is calculated for you in research only the field(s) needed for you to be able to gain that technology. Then you’ll never use more resources than necessary to learn a technology. Ultimately, though, it costs the same to research all technology. The added


costs encourage you to develop a few initial technologies quickly and take

### Generalized

Research can be cheaper for some races than others. To learn how efficient dedicated to your race is at performing research, choose the View (Race) menu item, then research will be turn to page 6 of the View Race dialog. Both the Technology Browser and applied to the pages 2 and 3 of the View Race dialog show you which technologies you

9 SHIP AND STARBASE DESIGN

Use the Ship and Starbase Designer to create, edit and delete new ship and starbase designs. Once you create a new ship design you can add it to the production queue of any of your planets that has a starbase with a space

You don’t need a starbase to build a starbase. If your colony has the resources
