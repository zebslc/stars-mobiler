### Special Bombs

Claim Adjuster races can learn to build the Retro bomb, a type of terraforming
weapon used to return the planet to its original conditions.

Smart Bombs destroy colonists, but not Mines or Factories. They are twice as
effective as other bombs at penetrating planetary defenses.                        Retro Bomb

## MINERAL PACKET BOMBARDMENT

If your starbase has a mass driver, you can fling mineral packets against          Smart Bomb
planets with no mass driver or a lesser mass driver. This will destroy colonists
and installations, and is cheaper than building and sending bombers (as long
as you can afford to throw away the minerals). A warp 13 mineral packet is as
close as Stars! comes to having a doomsday weapon.

### You can defend against this type of attack by building a mass driver to catch

the packets. If the sending driver is more powerful, you’ll at least slow the
packets down and reduce the damage. The next best thing is to have good
planetary defenses. If you’re fast enough you may be able to intercept the         Defenses are

## GROUND COMBAT

To invade another player ’s planet and initiate ground combat:
1. Build a fleet with one or more freighters.
2. In the Waypoint Task tile, use the Transport task to load colonists onto the
fleet. Try to load what you think will be an overwhelming number.
3. Set a waypoint to your opponent’s planet.
4. Use the Transport task to drop all colonists at the new waypoint.

If the planet has a starbase, you’ll have to destroy it before you can transfer
your troops to the surface.

set to blow, one quarter of the mines in the field will detonate at the end of
each subsequent turn.

To remotely detonate a minefield:
1. Select the minefield in the scanner. If more than one object is present, right-click on the field and select it from the popup list.

A summary of the field appears in the Selection Summary pane.
2. Check Detonate Mine Field Next Year in the Summary pane.

All ships in the field take damage as if they hit a mine. To stop the minefield(s)
from continuing to detonate, just uncheck the Detonate... box on your next
turn.

## STARBASE COMBAT

Starbases take part in combat. They don’t move but have an
initiative of 10 to 18.

## CLAIM ADJUSTERS AND TERRAFORMING AS A WEAPON

### Races based on the Claim Adjuster trait can perform negative terraforming on

an enemy’s planet while in orbit. If the planet has a starbase, you must
destroy it before you can begin this type of attack.

### Orbital Terraforming

Terraforming from orbit requires a fleet outfitted with Orbital Adjusters. These
are described in the Mining Robots section of the Technology Browser. Every
race with the Claim Adjuster trait starts out with one ship outfitted with
Orbital Adjusters.                                                                 Orbital Adjuster

Terraforming from orbit can also be used as a weapon: just orbit the planet
and start to terraform it under your opponent’s feet. This allows you to prepare
more favorable conditions for a planetary invasion. Depending on your
opponent’s level of terraforming technology, using terraforming as an attack
could turn into a shoving match if they begin terraforming operations of their
own.

Terraforming from orbit happens automatically as soon as your fleet arrives.
Just set the destination planet as the fleet waypoint. No waypoint task is
necessary. Your fleets will automatically perform negative terraforming for
Enemies and positive terraforming for friends.

### Retro Bomb

Claim Adjusters also can gain the Retro bomb, a type of terraforming weapon
used to return the planet to its original conditions. This is useful if you know
your opponent has been working hard to change the habitability value of the        Retro Bomb
planet, and especially if the original planetary environment was more suitable
for your race than the current environment.

## DECLARING ENEMIES AND FRIENDS

In a single player game, everyone is your enemy. In a multi-player game, you
designate who you do and do not wish to attack.
- Select Player Relations from the Commands menu to specify your
enemies, your friends, and races you have no feelings for whatsoever
(neutral).

CO MB AT   15-11

When you give a fleet attack orders you can choose who to attack: all
enemies, all neutrals and enemies, everybody or a just a specific opponent.

Friends are also immune to your minefields, automatically refuel at your
starbases and are allowed to use your stargates.

Fleets with the waypoint task of Patrol will only attack Enemies.

### Unwilling Participants and Innocent Bystanders

If you declare another player to be your friend you may be unexpectedly
drawn into battles. If a friend of yours is attacked and you have a fleet at the
same location your fleet will automatically join the battle even if it does not
have attack orders. Yegads.

If both players are your friends, you can sit on the sidelines and watch or be
on your merry way.

## BATTLE PLANS

Battle plans specify the behavior of your ships in a confrontation. When you
specify attack orders, you choose a battle plan that defines the attack and
defense.
- Modify or delete an existing plan, or create a new plan, using the
Commands (Battle Plans ) menu item.

Stars! provides several pre-defined battle plans to help you start. To learn the
contents of a plan, select it from the list in the Battle Plans dialog. Then look
at the options chosen for target, tactics, and, if you’re in a multi-player game, the victim. You can modify, rename or delete an existing plan, or copy it and
use it as the basis for a new plan.

All new ships start out with the Default battle plan. This plan sets up a default
attack strategy if the fleet is armed, and a default flight strategy is the fleet is
unarmed. You can’t rename or delete the Default plan, but you can modify it.

useful for crippling enemy battle groups while attempting to avoid their heavy
guns.

Primary target: Armed Ships; Secondary target: None/Disengage

### This would try to take out all enemy armed ships and the armed enemy

starbase, leaving unarmed ships alone. This is useful if you plan on stealing
cargo from the unarmed ships (assuming you survive).

Primary target: Armed Ships; Secondary target: Bombers/Freighters
This ignores anything that isn’t armed, or a bomber or freighter. This prevents
you from wasting shots on harmless ships.

Make sure your battle plan reflects what you really want your ships to do. For
example, if you specify a target of Any and the closest ship happens to be an
unarmed freighter instead of the enemy’s battleships, you will waste a round
destroying an easy target while the opponent’s battleships pound you into
space dust. In this case, choosing a target of Armed Ships would be much
more appropriate.

### Battle Tactics

A fleet’s battle plan lists a tactic for each general target type: Any, Armed
Ships, Starbase, etc. Tactics fall into three styles: disengage, minimize personal
damage, and maximize opponent damage. Each tactic determines how much
damage each token, or group of ships of the same design, will attempt to both
inflict and expose itself to.

### In all cases except Disengage the token will attempt to get closer to the target

if it is currently outside maximum range. If the token runs out of primary and
secondary targets it will automatically switch to Disengage. If a token can no
longer do any damage it will automatically Disengage. For example if the
attacking token has shield buster weapons only and none of the enemy tokens
have shields, the attacker will disengage.

### Example use of

Disengage in
targeting and as a
tactic.

Choose tactics to use on primary and secondary targets. A tactic applies to the
entire fleet.
- Disengage — Attempt to run away as soon as possible. Seven squares of
movement on the battle board are required to leave the battle. As
movement ranges from       square to 2  squares per round it can take
from 3 to 14 rounds to disengage.

- Maximize net damage – Attempt to get in range of the target class with all
of your ship’s weapons, then move in such a way as to always do some
damage while maximizing damage_done/damage_taken.
- Maximize damage ratio – Attempts to get in range of at least one ship of
the target class and move in such a way as to do some damage while
maximizing damage_done/damage_taken.
- Maximize damage – Attempts to get in range of at least one ship of the
target class with all your ships weapons, then tries to maximize the
damage done. This tactic does not care about damage taken.
- Dump Cargo - Jettison cargo at the start of battle.

CO MB AT   15-15

### Maximize Damage Ratio will not necessarily close to what may be considered

the best location for you ship’s weapons if it is carrying both short and long
range weapons. For example, if you design a cruiser that carries range 6
missiles and a range 2 beam weapon, odds are that you will never get closer
than range 6 in the battle. This is an advantage if when you want to use the
short range weapons strictly as a deterrent against fast ships that try to get in
close and destroy you with their short range weapons. If you do want to get
closer and bring all weapons to bear, use Maximize Net Damage or Maximize
Damage tactics.

### Making a New Battle Plan

1. Choose the Commands (Battle Plan) menu item or choose Battle Plans...
from the Fleet Composition tile.
2. Select an existing battle plan from the Plan dropdown.
3. Click on the Copy button to copy an existing plan. If the list is full (14
plans), select an existing plan you are willing to replace.
4. In the Primary Target dropdown, select a primary target for the fleet to
attack.
5. Select a Secondary Target.
6. Select a Tactic.
7. In a multi-player game you can choose Who to attack . In games with
only AI opponents all other players are your enemies.
7. Choose Dump Cargo to jettison cargo at the start of battle.
8. Click on the Rename button and type in a new name.
9. Click on OK. The new plan will appear in the Waypoint Tasks tile the
next time you choose an Attack task.

### Changing the Contents of a Battle Plan

You may find that your battle plans need fine tuning over time. Here’s how to
change one:
1. In the Battle Plans dialog, select an existing battle plan from the Plan
dropdown.
2. Click in the Primary Target dropdown and select a target type.
