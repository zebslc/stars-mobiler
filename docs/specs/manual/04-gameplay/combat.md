## BOMBING PLANETS

Bombing happens automatically. All you need to do is send your bomber fleet to the enemy planet. If the planet does not have a starbase, the fleet begins to bomb types and bomb on arrival. (If the planet has a starbase, you’ll have to destroy it before peek at the Bombs

### Technology

You specify the type of bombs a particular bomber design carries when you design the ship. Your bombers have an infinite number of bombs, allowing hull, the number of bombs you place in each bomb slot is the number dropped on that planet per year. You may notice that the enemy population reduction doesn’t always match chapter 9. your calculations when bombing. For example, the Summary pane reports that the population is 400,000. You receive a report saying your bombs destroyed 65,000 colonists. Now the Summary pane says the population is

The population report of an opponent’s world is always an estimate. The number shown is +/- 20% of the actual value. Since you aren’t on the surface, you won’t be able to take an accurate count — until the count is zero.


### Special Bombs

Claim Adjuster races can learn to build the Retro bomb, a type of terraforming weapon used to return the planet to its original conditions.

Smart Bombs destroy colonists, but not Mines or Factories. They are twice as

## MINERAL PACKET BOMBARDMENT

If your starbase has a mass driver, you can fling mineral packets against planets with no mass driver or a lesser mass driver. This will destroy colonists and installations, and is cheaper than building and sending bombers (as long as you can afford to throw away the minerals). A warp 13 mineral packet is as close as Stars! comes to having a doomsday weapon.

### You can defend against this type of attack by building a mass driver to catch

the packets. If the sending driver is more powerful, you’ll at least slow the packets down and reduce the damage. The next best thing is to have good planetary defenses. If you’re fast enough you may be able to intercept the packets in flight (assuming it will take the packet more than one year to reach described in the its destination) and transfer their load into your cargo holds.


### You receive a warning message if your scanners can spot incoming packets

before they arrive.

## GROUND COMBAT

To invade another player ’s planet and initiate ground combat: 2. In the Waypoint Task tile, use the Transport task to load colonists onto the fleet. Try to load what you think will be an overwhelming number. 4. Use the Transport task to drop all colonists at the new waypoint.

If the planet has a starbase, you’ll have to destroy it before you can transfer

You’ll lose some of your colonist troops when you transport them through the planetary defenses. Planetary defenses are 75% effective against enemy colonist drops. Your troops that make it to the surface and your opponent’s

### Reality races

colonists fight until only one side remains. Capturing a planet in this way allows you to keep any surviving mines and factories. If everyone is killed, the planet is up for grabs to the first player who colonizes it. Such planets must be recolonized using a colonization fleet. If the planet is not habitable by your colonists, have the fleet load all of your colonists the next year. This prevents you from losing colonists to the worlds. You cannot invade any planet that has a starbase in orbit. This means you’ll need to destroy any starbase with your battle ships before you can beam

### MINEFIELDS consider creating a

You can string minefields around your planet or anywhere else in the universe. Minefields are typically a defensive strategy. If you have the Space you start the game. Demolition trait you can also remotely detonate minefields, turning them into

Only ships that carry mine layers can lay minefields.


### Players Affected by Minefields

Mines are not set off by fleets belonging to you or your friends. Only neutral and enemy fleets will have trouble navigating the your minefields.

### Minefields as

Minefields in the Scanner Fields overlay. Minefields are displayed in the

### Mine layers are

Laying Minefields Only a ship with a mine layer can lay minefields. You’ll need to research Energy and Biotechnology for mines that explode, and Propulsion and Biology for Speed Trap mines. Once you’ve gained the technology, use the ship designer to add mine layers to a ship hull. Build the ship and you’re ready to go. To lay a minefield:

### Add a Waypoint

pane. 2. In the Scanner, click once on the waypoint where you will lay the mines. This can be a planet or point in space. 3. In the Waypoint Task tile, click on the dropdown and select Lay Mine Fields.

The Waypoint task tile notes how many mines that fleet can lay per year. Stars! supports laying up to 1,000,000 mines in a field, at a rate of more than


### Minefield Coverage

Use the Scanner ’s Mine Fields overlay to show the area of space covered by the field. Click on the field to display the mine type, field size, decay rate, and owner in the Selection Summary pane.

### Minefield Decay

Minefields decay at a rate of 1% a year. You should plan to replenish the fields as If you have the needed. (If enemy or neutral ships thin them out, you’ll need to rebuild as well.) Space Demolition Minefields decay an additional 4% a year for each planet they contain. The maximum decay rate for a minefield is 50%.

### Sweeping Minefields

Ships and Starbases with beam weapons can sweep minefields. You can only sweep minefields belonging to Neutrals and Enemies. Sweeping minefields happens automatically. If you’re flying through a neutral or enemy minefield and your fleet carries beam weapons with a range of 1 or greater, you’ll start - To display minefields you know about, turn on the Scanner pane’s Mine Fields overlay.

beam_weapon_power * weapon_range_squared


Do this for all beams in the fleet, then add all the answers. The sum will be the number of mines you’ll sweep each year. If the fleet is in are swept at only more than one minefield, it sweeps this number simultaneously from

Range zero and shield only weapons can not sweep mines at all. Gattling weapons are more effective at sweeping minefields. Consult the Technology Browser to learn the exact level of effectiveness of any particular weapon.

### Remotely Detonating Minefields section of the

You must be playing a Space Demolition race to remotely detonate your minefields. You can detonate only minefields made of Standard Mines. Once set to blow, one quarter of the mines in the field will detonate at the end of each subsequent turn.

To remotely detonate a minefield: 1. Select the minefield in the scanner. If more than one object is present, right-click on the field and select it from the popup list.

A summary of the field appears in the Selection Summary pane.

All ships in the field take damage as if they hit a mine. To stop the minefield(s) from continuing to detonate, just uncheck the Detonate... box on your next

## STARBASE COMBAT

Starbases take part in combat. They don’t move but have an

starbase. A starbase can be designated as the primary target using the Battle Plans dialog. It can be selected as the only primary target, and To learn about is also included when you select Armed Ships as a primary target. All weapons on a starbase receive a range bonus of +1.


## CLAIM ADJUSTERS AND TERRAFORMING AS A WEAPON

### Races based on the Claim Adjuster trait can perform negative terraforming on

an enemy’s planet while in orbit. If the planet has a starbase, you must

### Orbital Terraforming

Terraforming from orbit requires a fleet outfitted with Orbital Adjusters. These are described in the Mining Robots section of the Technology Browser. Every race with the trait starts out with one ship outfitted with Orbital Adjusters.

Terraforming from orbit can also be used as a weapon: just orbit the planet and start to terraform it under your opponent’s feet. This allows you to prepare more favorable conditions for a planetary invasion. Depending on your opponent’s level of terraforming technology, using terraforming as an attack could turn into a shoving match if they begin terraforming operations of their

Terraforming from orbit happens automatically as soon as your fleet arrives. Just set the destination planet as the fleet waypoint. No waypoint task is necessary. Your fleets will automatically perform negative terraforming for Enemies and positive terraforming for friends.

### Retro Bomb

Claim Adjusters also can gain the Retro bomb, a type of terraforming weapon used to return the planet to its original conditions. This is useful if you know your opponent has been working hard to change the habitability value of the planet, and especially if the original planetary environment was more suitable

## DECLARING ENEMIES AND FRIENDS

In a single player game, everyone is your enemy. In a multi-player game, you - Select Player Relations from the Commands menu to specify your enemies, your friends, and races you have no feelings for whatsoever (neutral).

When you give a fleet attack orders you can choose who to attack: all enemies, all neutrals and enemies, everybody or a just a specific opponent.

Friends are also immune to your minefields, automatically refuel at your

Fleets with the waypoint task of Patrol will only attack Enemies.

### Unwilling Participants and Innocent Bystanders

If you declare another player to be your friend you may be unexpectedly drawn into battles. If a friend of yours is attacked and you have a fleet at the same location your fleet will automatically join the battle even if it does not

If both players are your friends, you can sit on the sidelines and watch or be

## BATTLE PLANS

Battle plans specify the behavior of your ships in a confrontation. When you specify attack orders, you choose a battle plan that defines the attack and - Modify or delete an existing plan, or create a new plan, using the

Stars! provides several pre-defined battle plans to help you start. To learn the contents of a plan, select it from the list in the Battle Plans dialog. Then look at the options chosen for target, tactics, and, if you’re in a multi-player game, the victim. You can modify, rename or delete an existing plan, or copy it and


### Unmodified Default

field in the plan.

All new ships start out with the Default battle plan. This plan sets up a default attack strategy if the fleet is armed, and a default flight strategy is the fleet is unarmed. You can’t rename or delete the Default plan, but you can modify it.

### Battle plans for a fleet are selected in


### Targeting

For each attacking token, or group of ships of the same design in a fleet, and each round of battle, Stars! tries to pick the right target from all the other type; for example; Any, Starbase, or Armed Ships. If no target is found, Stars! looks for targets matching the secondary target type, attacking the first matching target found. If no target is found, the attacking token disengages. - None/Disengage — Don’t look for a target, just attempt to disengage.. broken into phases, - Starbase — Target the opponent’s starbase whether it is armed or not. - Armed Ships — Target any ship or starbase carrying weapons (does not include bombers). Preference is given to the strongest tokens this token is

- Unarmed Ships — Target any ship not carrying weapons or bombs..

### Starbases and

Here are a few examples of targeting:

### Starbases use a

Primary target: Bombers/Freighters; Secondary target: Fuel Transports Any enemy bombers and freighters are targeted first. Once they are gone, the attacker looks for and tries to destroy enemy Fuel Transports. This tactic is useful for crippling enemy battle groups while attempting to avoid their heavy

Primary target: Armed Ships; Secondary target: None/Disengage

### This would try to take out all enemy armed ships and the armed enemy

starbase, leaving unarmed ships alone. This is useful if you plan on stealing

Primary target: Armed Ships; Secondary target: Bombers/Freighters This ignores anything that isn’t armed, or a bomber or freighter. This prevents

Make sure your battle plan reflects what you really want your ships to do. For example, if you specify a target of Any and the closest ship happens to be an unarmed freighter instead of the enemy’s battleships, you will waste a round destroying an easy target while the opponent’s battleships pound you into space dust. In this case, choosing a target of Armed Ships would be much

### Battle Tactics

A fleet’s battle plan lists a tactic for each general target type: Any, Armed Ships, Starbase, etc. Tactics fall into three styles: disengage, minimize personal damage, and maximize opponent damage. Each tactic determines how much damage each token, or group of ships of the same design, will attempt to both

### In all cases except Disengage the token will attempt to get closer to the target

if it is currently outside maximum range. If the token runs out of primary and secondary targets it will automatically switch to Disengage. If a token can no longer do any damage it will automatically Disengage. For example if the attacking token has shield buster weapons only and none of the enemy tokens


### Example use of

Choose tactics to use on primary and secondary targets. A tactic applies to the - Disengage — Attempt to run away as soon as possible. Seven squares of movement on the battle board are required to leave the battle. As movement ranges from square to 2  squares per round it can take - Disengage if challenged – Behaves like Maximize damage until the token this battle board, this token can do the most damage to its target while taking the least - Maximize net damage – Attempt to get in range of the target class with all of your ship’s weapons, then move in such a way as to always do some - Maximize damage ratio – Attempts to get in range of at least one ship of the target class and move in such a way as to do some damage while - Maximize damage – Attempts to get in range of at least one ship of the target class with all your ships weapons, then tries to maximize the

CO MB AT 15-15

### Maximize Damage Ratio will not necessarily close to what may be considered

the best location for you ship’s weapons if it is carrying both short and long range weapons. For example, if you design a cruiser that carries range 6 missiles and a range 2 beam weapon, odds are that you will never get closer than range 6 in the battle. This is an advantage if when you want to use the short range weapons strictly as a deterrent against fast ships that try to get in close and destroy you with their short range weapons. If you do want to get closer and bring all weapons to bear, use Maximize Net Damage or Maximize Damage tactics.
