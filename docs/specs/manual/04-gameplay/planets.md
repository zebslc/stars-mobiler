The essence of Stars! is resource management. To win, learn what it takes to
smoothly and effectively grow and manage your empire’s industrial
infrastructure. Learn when to colonize, when to move people and other
resources so that your empire becomes stronger and more balanced with
each passing year. Learn how to make resource management more expensive
for your opponents than it is for you. When you attack, look for targets
where the cost to your opponent is greater than your investment in the
offense. (This is especially true in a solo game.)

6               PLANETS

Planets are the gold nuggets of the Stars! universe: everybody
wants them, and hardly anyone wants to share. ‘Green’worlds
give your people a place to grow, learn and produce. The
minerals in each planet provide the building blocks for all the
technology you create, including planetary installations such as
defenses and scanners, and starbases with stargates that act as navigational
shortcuts and mass drivers that fling minerals between systems.

When you click on a planet in the Scanner, you’re actually selecting a star
system. The planet that appears on your screen is the most desirable planet in
that system. (There may be lesser rocks in the system, too, but you won’t want
them.) If you colonize a planet, it becomes your capitol world in that system, the local center of government and industry. If the planet is dangerous to your
people, you can mine it from orbit, and ship its valuable minerals to other
parts of your empire. If the planet is inhabited by another player, you can try
to take it away. If the owner is another human, you can also try to establish
trade relations.

No matter how you play, you need to give your people room to grow. That
growth rate will vary on any given planet, depending on the levels of gravity, temperature, and radiation. You can create a race that is immune to one or
more of these environmental factors—a very expensive advantage. You can
also make a planet’s environment more hospitable by terraforming.

## YOUR HOME WORLD AND OTHER INHABITED PLANETS

You start the game on your home world, a place with optimal environmental
conditions where you have a small but thriving population, basic industry in
the form of factories and mines, fundamental technology, and a short range, planet-based scanner. In orbit, you have a starbase capable of building ships
and providing a small amount of planetary defense. Each player’s home

## MINERALS

All planets contain three important raw minerals: ironium, boranium and
germanium. These provide the building blocks for almost everything your race
produces. Minerals exist both on and under the planet’s surface. Minerals
found on the surface can be used immediately in production. Those under the
surface must be mined to become available for use. Minerals can be

A scanner is the inhabited planet’s radar, giving you information
about all objects within scanner range. There are several types of
planet-based scanners, with different ranges for detecting fleets, mass packets, mine fields and wormholes, and different ranges for
detecting the environment and mineral content of other planets. You start the
game with a basic scanner on your home planet.

The cost of building a scanner is fixed. Once you build a scanner, it will

starbases in the score.

Space Dock — Ship building capacity: 200kT or smaller ships. This hull

### Upgrading a Starbase

You can upgrade a starbase by changing the hull or by adding or changing
items in the hull slots. You receive full credit for the existing installation, paying only the difference between the old and new hulls. The upgrade
appears in the production inventory, ready for you to add to the production
queue when you wish.

Here’s how the cost is determined:

If the hull changes:
- You receive a 50% credit for minerals and resources used in the original
starbase.

If the hull does not change:
- Slots where the components don’t change are free.
- Slots where only the count of the component increases cost only the
component price multiplied by the number of additional items.
- Slots where the component type changes to a similar component are
discounted in cost; the discount based on the closeness of the part types.
- Slots where the component type changes dramatically cost the full price
of the new component. You will receive some minerals back if the old
components are recycled.

## MASS DRIVER BASICS

### Mass drivers provide a fuel-free method of transporting mineral

cargo packets between planets, and, secondarily, can act as an
effective long range weapon. Mineral packets are bundles of
ironium, germanium and boranium. Mass drivers fling mineral
packets at high rates of acceleration. This prevents you from flinging Fuel, which would explode, or colonists, who would, well, also explode.

In the Scanner pane, a mass driver appears as a purple dot orbiting the planet.

### Building a Mass Driver

A mass driver occupies the Orbital slot in a starbase hull. You’ll have to
research Energy—the requirement for each type of driver is listed in the
Orbital section of the Technology Browser.

Once you complete your research, upgrade your starbase hull design to hold
the driver (or design a new starbase hull that includes the driver). To upgrade
a hull and add the driver:
1. Choose the Commands (Ship Design...) menu item, opening the Ship and
Starbase Designer.
2. Under Design, click on Starbase.
3. Select the design you wish to upgrade from the dropdown.
4. Click on Copy Selected Design. The dialog changes, offering the design
and a component list.

### You may fling packets at speeds up to three Warp levels above the rated

speed. Packets flung above the rated speed become unstable, decaying at
10% per year for one warp level above the rated speed, 20% for two warp
levels, and 50% for three warp levels. Packets decay in the year they are
launched and in the year they arrive at a planet proportional to the distance
they travel in those years.

During a packet’s first year out, it travels only half the normal distance, then
the normal distance in any following years of travel. Since production
happens all year long, the packets could be launched at any point. Stars!
simplifies this by averaging it out to a half-year’s travel.

You can’t attack mineral packets. You can only intercept them and transfer

### Stealing Mineral Packets

If you can intercept a mineral packet in flight you can steal from it. When a
packet is at the same location as your selected fleet, it appears in the Other
Fleets Here tile. Use the Cargo button and the Cargo Transfer dialog that
appears to transfer minerals from the packet to your fleet.

### Building Two Mass Drivers on a Starbase

You can build up to two identical mass drivers on the same starbase
(assuming you haven’t used an Orbital slot with a stargate already). This has
two advantages: 1) you can catch incoming packets at one warp speed greater

Click on a planet in the Scanner pane, then look in the Selection Summary
pane. The habitability value shows the current value of the planet followed in
parentheses by the value the planet would be after terraforming (given the
limits of your current technology).

The environment graph shows how much you can modify the planet’s
environment, given your level of terraforming technology. The following
graph shows that the player possesses Gravity and Radiation terraforming
technology, and that Radiation must be terraformed to make the planet
habitable. Gravity is currently well within this race’s habitable range, and may
be terraformed to the optimum level.

PLAN ETS   6-15

### Habitable range

the exact range

Original     Current value        Best value possible applying

You don’t have to worry about the order in which the different factors are
terraformed. The terraforming task that appears in the production dialog
always works on the factor that is the furthest out of range. If you can improve
Gravity by 3%, Temperature by 5% and Radiation by 2% the Production
dialog will let you add 10% Terraforming to the queue. Each 1% Terraforming
task executed will modify one of the environmental factors by 1%, which will
improve the overall habitability value by at least 1% and probably more.

Find out which factor should be terraformed to maximize the planet’s
habitability value by clicking in the environment graph of the Summary pane.

### A pop-up will tell you the potential increase in habitability value if you

modify that factor to the limits of your current level of technology.

There are two basic ways to terraform a planet. The first and easiest is to add
auto-build terraforming tasks to the production queue. Min and Max

### Terraforming are auto-build tasks which remain in the queue and operate only

when both necessary and possible. These can be added manually or using a
production template. The second method is to manually add the Terraform
Environment task to the production queue.

6-16    P LAYI NG ST AR S !

Terraforming tasks can use only the terraforming technology you possess. So, if you have only Radiation and Temperature Terraforming, you can modify
only radiation and temperature levels, but not gravity. The terraforming will
automatically act first on the environmental attribute which when modified
will most improve the planet’s habitability.

### Colonists Die if Minimum Terraforming Lasts More than One Year

If it takes longer than one year after colonizing to bring the planet to a           Claim Adjusters
habitability value of 0% or better, your colonists will start to die. If you can     Claim Adjusters

### Terraforming with Auto-build Tasks

1. Bring the planet you wish to terraform under command.
2. Click on Change in the Production tile. The Production dialog opens.
3. In the production inventory, click on either the Min Terraform or Max
Terraform auto-build tasks. Then click on Add to raise the limit to which
the task will terraform.

Minimal (Min) terraforming changes only those environmental factors that
have a negative value and that you have the technology to change, up to the
percentage you specify in the task. Terraforming will continue only until the
habitability value reaches zero. To go beyond the point of minimal
terraforming, you must manually add Terraform Environment or the Max
Terraforming auto-build task. Minimal Terraforming will activate and terraform
only when there are resources available and not doing so would cause people
to die on the planet (from negative environment values or overcrowding).

PLAN ET S        6-17

### Max Terraforming changes any environmental attributes that you have the

technology to change, up to the percentage you specify in the task.

As each terraforming task completes, an environmental factor is improved by
1%.

### Terraforming as a Default Action

Command pane.
2. Click on Change in the Production tile.
3. In the production inventory, click on the Terraform Environment task.
Then click on Add to add the desired number of this task to perform.

### Each Terraform Environment task you add to the production queue improves

an environment factor by 1%. The number of tasks you may add to the queue
is limited by the current level of your terraforming technology. When you
have successfully completed all the tasks you can add to the queue, the
Terraform Environment task disappears from the production inventory. It will
reappear once you achieve a higher level of technology that allows you to
terraform further.

### Types of Terraforming Technology

Each of a planet’s three environmental factors has a matching type of
terraforming technology: Temperature Terraforming, Gravity Terraforming, and
Radiation Terraforming. Each requires a different combination of research:
- Temperature terraforming requires research into Biotechnology and                  The Total
Energy.                                                                            Terraforming trait
requires that you
- Gravity terraforming requires research into Biotechnology and Propulsion.          research only

### Biotechnology to
- Radiation terraforming requires research into Biotechnology and                    learn terraforming
technology
Weapons.

Each technology allows you to improve a specific factor a minimum of 3%
from its initial value and a maximum (without Total Terraforming) of 15%.

### The percentage of improvement does not always indicate how much the

value of the planet will increase. Often only one or two environmental factors
will be negative, while the remaining factors look pretty attractive. In this case
improving the negative factors can improve the planet’s overall value to a
much higher percentage than that indicated by the technology.

As you upgrade your terraforming technology, you’ll see the amount you can
improve the planet increase. You may also see that some planets that were
previously not terraformable (red in Planet Value view) become terraformable
(yellow in Planet Value view).

### To learn more about the individual types of terraforming technology and their

research requirements, open the Technology Browser (Press F2) and select
Terraforming from the dropdown list.

### Total Terraforming

Total Terraforming is a race trait, not a type of technology. Races
with Total Terraforming begin the game with the ability to
improve temperature, gravity and radiation levels up to 3%.
Terraforming requires 30% less resources and you can research

as soon as the planet is deserted or taken over, the environmental conditions
revert to their original values.

### As the race learns more about terraforming all its planets are automatically

Claim Adjusters and Terraforming Other Players’ Planets from Orbit
Races based on the Claim Adjuster trait can terraform other player’s planets
from orbit. This creates unique opportunities for diplomacy or war. If the
owner is your Friend, you automatically perform positive terraforming
(adjusting planetary conditions toward the inhabitants’ optimal conditions). If
the owner is your Enemy, you perform negative terraforming.

Terraforming from orbit requires a fleet outfitted with Orbital Adjusters. These
are described in the Mining Robots section of the Technology Browser. Every
race with the Claim Adjuster trait starts out with one ship outfitted with
Orbital Adjusters.

### Orbital Adjuster

Terraforming from orbit is a great vehicle for diplomacy: in return for other
technology, an alliance, or just a plain thank you, you can help your friends

example, if the inhabitants have 3% terraforming and you possess 5%
terraforming, the planet can be improved up to 5% from its original
conditions (not exceeding optimal conditions for the inhabitants).

Terraforming from orbit can also be used as a weapon: just orbit the planet
and start to terraform it under your opponent’s feet. This allows you to prepare
more favorable conditions for a planetary invasion. You must destroy any
existing starbase before you can launch this type of attack. Depending on

Upgrades of existing items, such as stargates and starbase hulls, will replace
any older versions in the inventory list. When you upgrade a item, it is
labeled in the inventory as an upgrade. Since upgrades enhance rather than
replace an item, they only require enough minerals to create the
enhancements.
