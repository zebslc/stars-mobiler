## HOW TO APPROACH HULL DESIGN

Develop a strategy for deciding when to create a new design. If you create a Example new design every time you successfully research a new piece of technology,

same time. Try to leave room for at least one additional design, so that you colonized most or can create a new design quickly without first deleting an existing design. You all planets within could also create a new design for an existing class of ship, such as a colonizer, when the existing design has outlived its usefulness.


### Spend time in the Technology Browser learning about the ship technology you

think you’ll want to research. Take ship design into account when you plan your research strategies. If possible, design new ships only when you gain the technology you need to make a significant advance over older designs.

## DESIGNING A NEW HULL FROM SCRATCH

### Hull schematics show the type and number of components a hull is designed

to hold. The schematic is made up of component slots that only accept the type and number of components indicated by their labels. Cargo spaces only

## EDITING AN EXISTING HULL DESIGN

Only designs for which no ships exist may be edited. 4. Drag the components to be removed from the ship schematic to the

If you wish, replace the old components with new ones from the ship component list. Drag them over to the ship schematic and release.

## DELETING AN EXISTING HULL DESIGN

If you delete an existing design, all ships that use that design are destroyed, and their minerals are lost to the cosmos. If you wish to retrieve some of the minerals used in the ship, scrap all the ships using that design, then delete the

A plaque appears below ship schematics of existing designs. It tells you how many ships built on the selected design still exist. If you delete an existing design, any existing ships built with that design will be destroyed.

In this case, all 19 ships built on this design have already been destroyed. Deleting this design will not destroy any existing ships.

In this case, 34 out of the 36 ships built on this design remain intact. Deleting this design will destroy all 34 remaining ships. Ships destroyed by this mechanism are not recycled for scrap.

### Deleting Designs Using the Ship and Starbase Designer

1. In the Ship and Starbase Designer, select Existing Designs. 2. Click on the dropdown list and select the design to delete.

### Other Methods of Deleting Hull Designs

Pick a design that is no longer useful (too slow, ineffective weapons). Before you delete the design, think of the most advantageous way to get rid any existing ships of that design. The following provide example strategies:

Example 1: Send each ship of the design to planets that need minerals. Set the waypoint task at each planet to Scrap Fleet . A portion of the minerals will be returned to the surface supply on that planet. If you use this method, you’ll have to wait until all the affected ships reach their assigned waypoints.

Example 2: Delete all the ships at in one stroke using the Ship and Starbase Designer. You’ll be warned that all the ships of that design will be destroyed. When you delete ships this way you receive NO minerals.


Example 3: If the ships of the type you wish to delete use any weapons, use them in a large battle as distracting cannon fodder, possibly keeping your

## COUNTING THE NUMBER OF HULL DESIGNS

To learn the total number of designs you’ve created: 1. In the Ship and Starbase Designer, select Existing Designs. 2. Click on the dropdown menu and count the number of designs. This

### Scanner Types

There are three basic types of ship-based scanners: those that scan planets from orbit; those that scan planets from orbit and fleets from a distance; and those that scan both planets and fleets from a distance. One scanner, the

### Scanners are Cumulative choices on issues

Multiple scanners on a single ship are cumulative. Fleets are still limited to the range of the best ship in the fleet, but a particular ship’s scanner range is a modified sum of the ranges of its scanners. The formula for calculating a ship’s scanner range is the 4th root of the sum of each scanner to the 4th power. Let’s say you have a ship design with two 100 light year scanners and one 60 light year scanner. (100^4 + 100^4 + 60^4) ^ ⁄ = 120 light years. The same calculation applies to planet penetrating scanners.


## ADDING CLOAKING DEVICES

A cloaking device reduces the range at which your opponents’ scanners can detect your fleets. There are several different types of Inner Strength trait cloaks, each reducing opponents’ scanner range by a specific on a ship can all be the same strength or of different strengths. Cloaking is device has the shared by an entire fleet: every ship not carrying a cloak is covered until it ability to reduce the leaves the fleet. When designing a ship, you can add a cloaking device to any slot labeled Electrical or General Purpose .

There are two basic types of Engines: the standard engine, which requires the anti-matter Fuel available at all full-serve starbases; and the ramscoop engine, which can scoop its fuel from the stuff of the universe. Both engines types have an absolute maximum speed of Warp 10. Each type has advantages and disadvantages, and several require the presence or absence of certain race Browser.

players. To receive a fleet you must have less than 16 different designs (the


10 MANAGING FLEETS

A fleet is a distinct group of one or more ships, and can be any mix of ship types. Fleets can be created, merged, and split at any point in the game. You design the ship types, add them to production queues, create fleets, then assign waypoints and tasks. Fleets can be used for exploration, defense and offense, colonizing, remote mining, and transporting minerals and people.
