could also create a new design for an existing class of ship, such as a           range of your

### Spend time in the Technology Browser learning about the ship technology you

think you’ll want to research. Take ship design into account when you plan
your research strategies. If possible, design new ships only when you gain the
technology you need to make a significant advance over older designs.

## DESIGNING A NEW HULL FROM SCRATCH

### Hull schematics show the type and number of components a hull is designed

to hold. The schematic is made up of component slots that only accept the
type and number of components indicated by their labels. Cargo spaces only
show cargo capacity — they do not accept components.

3. Click on Copy Selected Design .

If the Copy Selected Design button is shadowed, you’ve reached the
maximum of 16 concurrent ship designs. You must delete an existing
design before you can design a new ship.

## EDITING AN EXISTING HULL DESIGN

### Do the following if you want to change an existing design or create a new

design based on the existing design. You can edit a design only if none of
your existing ships use that design.
1. Select Existing Designs.
2. Click in the dropdown list and select the design.

4. Drag the components to be removed from the ship schematic to the
collection of ship components and release.

Drag the components one at a time, or hold down the CTRL key to drag

If you wish, replace the old components with new ones from the ship
component list. Drag them over to the ship schematic and release.
5. If you wish, the change design image and name.

### Rename the design

6. Save the design:
- To save the design under the same name, click on OK.

- To rename the design (creating a new design), click in the name field
and type in a new name. Then click on OK.

## DELETING AN EXISTING HULL DESIGN

If you delete an existing design, all ships that use that design are destroyed, and their minerals are lost to the cosmos. If you wish to retrieve some of the
minerals used in the ship, scrap all the ships using that design, then delete the
design.

A plaque appears below ship schematics of existing designs. It tells you how
many ships built on the selected design still exist. If you delete an existing
design, any existing ships built with that design will be destroyed.

In this case, all 19 ships built on this design have already been
destroyed. Deleting this design will not destroy any existing ships.

In this case, 34 out of the 36 ships built on this design remain
intact. Deleting this design will destroy all 34 remaining ships.
Ships destroyed by this mechanism are not recycled for scrap.

### Deleting Designs Using the Ship and Starbase Designer

1. In the Ship and Starbase Designer, select Existing Designs.
2. Click on the dropdown list and select the design to delete.
3. Click on Delete Existing Design .

### Other Methods of Deleting Hull Designs

Pick a design that is no longer useful (too slow, ineffective weapons). Before
you delete the design, think of the most advantageous way to get rid any
existing ships of that design. The following provide example strategies:

Example 1: Send each ship of the design to planets that need minerals. Set the
waypoint task at each planet to Scrap Fleet . A portion of the minerals will be
returned to the surface supply on that planet. If you use this method, you’ll
have to wait until all the affected ships reach their assigned waypoints.

Example 2: Delete all the ships at in one stroke using the Ship and Starbase
Designer. You’ll be warned that all the ships of that design will be destroyed.
When you delete ships this way you receive NO minerals.

Example 3: If the ships of the type you wish to delete use any weapons, use
them in a large battle as distracting cannon fodder, possibly keeping your
more advanced ships safer a little longer.

## COUNTING THE NUMBER OF HULL DESIGNS

To learn the total number of designs you’ve created:
1. In the Ship and Starbase Designer, select Existing Designs.
2. Click on the dropdown menu and count the number of designs. This
example shows five designs.

To learn how many ships of a single design are in play:
1. Select Existing Designs.
2. Click on the ship name in the dropdown list.
3. Look at the number displayed on the plaque under the dropdown:

### The first number shows how many ships of that type still

exist, the second shows how many you built since creating
the design. Here, one ship was built and is still in play.

Tip: You can locate

A fleet is a distinct group of one or more ships, and can be any mix of ship
types. Fleets can be created, merged, and split at any point in the game. You
design the ship types, add them to production queues, create fleets, then
assign waypoints and tasks. Fleets can be used for exploration, defense and
offense, colonizing, remote mining, and transporting minerals and people.
