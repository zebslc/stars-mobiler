# Managing Fleets

> Assembling fleets, warp speed, fuel, routing, merging, splitting, and scrapping.

---

## ASSEMBLING FLEETS

Each player can have up to 32,000 ships of each design in a fleet, with up to
16 different designs, and up to 512 fleets.

For some tasks a fleet with a single ship is sufficient. For example, exploration
or colonization usually only requires one ship outfitted with the appropriate
technology. However, for moving large quantities of minerals around, for
defending your planets and for attacking other players it’s very useful to have
large groups of ships in a single fleet.

You can merge and split fleets as you wish, using the Merge Fleets waypoint
task or the Merge and Split buttons in the Command pane. The affected ships
must be in the same location.

## WARP SPEED

A fleet’s warp speed determines the number of years it takes to reach a
waypoint, as well as fuel usage. Actual distance traveled is the square of the
warp speed. For example, a fleet traveling at Warp 8 will move up to 64 light
years each turn.

starbase or the fleet has Scrap Fleet or Colonize orders, or includes a hull with
a colony pod, the fleet travels at the maximum possible speed for its engine
and fuel supply.

### Maximum Speed

All engines have an absolute maximum speed, a maximum safe speed, a
maximum free speed and an optimum speed.

The absolute maximum speed for all engines is warp 10. The maximum safe
speed for most ships is warp 9. You can push your fleet to warp 10, but you’ll
have a 10% chance of losing each ship in the fleet at that speed. Only ships
using warp 10 capable engines can travel safely at warp 10. You can tell if an
engine is warp 10 capable by viewing it in the Technology Browser and
seeing if the area between warp 9 and 10 is covered with a yellow warning
pattern or not.

For most standard engines the maximum free speed is warp 1. This means that
you can travel at warp 1 using no fuel.

### For standard engines the optimum or best warp speed is the maximum speed

at less than 120% fuel usage. For Ramscoop engines the best warp speed is
the maximum speed that the engine can travel using no fuel. To learn the best
speed for a specific engine, visit the Engines section of the Technology
Browser. The Fuel Usage vs. Warp Speed graphs in the Browser shows this
speed for each engine. The following graph shows that the best warp speed
for this engine is warp 6.

The grid between warp 9 and 10 shows that the ship using that engine has a
10% chance of self-destructing while traveling at warp 10.

Travel Warp 1 without Using Fuel
Any ship can travel Warp 1 without using fuel. This means you travel 1 light
year per year of play. You also generate tiny amounts of fuel at Warp 1, and
may be able to put on small bursts of speed. This really is helpful only if
you’re close to your destination, almost out of fuel, and don’t want to bother
sending a rescue ship.

## FINDING A SPECIFIC FLEET

The simplest way to locate a planet or fleet is to use the Find command. Use
either the Command (Find) menu item, or press CTRL-F.

To find a fleet of your own, do one of the following:
- Enter the fleet number using any format (fleet #58, fleet 58, #58, 58).
- Enter the full name of the fleet.

To find another player ’s fleet:
- Enter the fleet identification using this format:

race_name fleet #fleet_number

If Stars! says it cannot find a planet or fleet by that name, try again, making
sure you type the correct name or number, or that you used the correct format
for finding another player ’s fleet. If you still can’t find a fleet, it may no longer
exist.

If you are looking for a fleet with a specific composition:

### Ship

1. Select the Scanner pane’s Ship Design Filter.                                    Design
filter
2. Select the ship type from the pop-up list. Only fleets that contain that type
of ship will appear in the Scanner.
3. Double-click on the fleets now shown in the Scanner. If more than one
fleet is at a location, continue to click. As you click, the fleets will cycle
through the Command pane. You can also use the Next or Prev buttons
on the Fleet tile, or click in the Fleet report--Reports (Fleets) menu item.

Details for each fleet are listed in the Fleet Composition tile.

## SWITCHING BETWEEN FLEETS

Switch between fleets using one of the following methods:
- Use the Find command (CTRL-F), then click on the ship in the Scanner
pane.
- Press the Prev and Next buttons on the Fleet tile to scroll through all your
fleets in the Command pane. The fleets appear in the current sort order of
the Fleet Summary Report.
- Click a location where more than one fleet is present. Right-click on the
spot and select another fleet from the pop-up list. Alternately, continue to
click in the location until the fleet appears in the Fleet tile.
- In the Other Fleets Here tile, select a fleet from the dropdown list.
- Click on the row for that fleet in the Fleet Summary Report.

## NAMING FLEETS

1. Select the fleet you wish to rename, displaying it in the Fleet tile.
2. Click on Rename in the Fleet tile.
3. Replace the existing text with your own more descriptive label.
4. OK the Rename dialog. The new name appears in the Fleet tile and
anywhere else you’d expect the name to be displayed.

You can use either the new name or the fleet number when Finding a fleet.
Other players cannot see the names you have given your fleets.

## USING FUEL

### Fuel is a manufactured commodity made of anti-matter and is measured in

milligrams (mg). This means it has little effect on the ship’s mass (and thus, fuel usage). Fuel can only be obtained from starbases with ship building
capability or from other fleets. It is also created by ships traveling at their
engine’s free speed, by fuel tankers and by ships with Anti-Matter Generators.

Fuel is shared by all ships in a fleet. The fuel capacity of a fleet is the sum of
the fuel capacity for each ship in the fleet. The rate at which fuel is used is
based partially on the mass of all ships and cargo in the fleet. Fuel usage is
also based on the rate at which each ship in the fleet uses fuel at a given
speed. All ship types can move at any speed, but they each burn different
amounts of fuel to achieve that speed. The total fuel usage for the fleet is the
sum of the fuel usage for all the individual ships.

Ship_fuel_usage = (ship_mass x efficiency x distance / 200 + 9) / 10

Fuel usage between waypoints is shown in the Fleet Waypoints tile. The
amount shown for reaching the selected waypoint is always exact.

### Estimated Fuel Usage for

travel from the current
waypoint to the fleet named
Perfect Logic #163, with
speed set to Warp 8.

### Sometimes Slowing Down Uses More Fuel

Each year’s travel is a separate jump that uses a finite, countable number of
milligrams of fuel. Let’s say that you have a fleet that can travel at warp 5 for
3mg per year of travel. A journey of 100ly would take 4 years and use 12mg
of fuel. If you slowed down to warp 4 it would only cost 2mg per year of
travel but the journey would take 7 years for a total of 14mg of fuel. This is a
case where it is more economical to go at the faster speed.

Routing automatically sends fleets from one planet to another. Stargates are         Fleet Waypoints tile
used, if they are available. If the destination planet is yours, and it also has a
route destination, the fleet will be passed automatically to the next point.

### Routing is most useful in large universes where you are regularly distributing

new ships from specialized production centers to other points in your empire.

### Routing can also be used to send existing fleets from one side of your empire

to the other, specifying only one waypoint within fuel range.

### Routing is a function

of a planet’s center of
production.

To set a planet’s route destination:
1. Click on the Route button in the planet’s Production tile.
2. Move your cursor to the scanner and click on the route destination. A line
appears between the origin and destination. Any ship that has route
orders will be sent to this destination, as well as any newly built fleet.

To pass fleets from route destination to route destination:
1. Set a route destination for each planet in your circuit or path.
2. Select the fleet to be routed.
3. Using the Waypoint Tasks tile, assign the fleet Route orders. When it
arrives at a planet with a route destination, it will automatically be passed
along. If the planet has a starbase with ship building capability, the fleet is
automatically refueled as well.

### Route Behavior

If the route destination is an uncolonized planet and fleet includes remote
miners, its orders are automatically changed at the destination to Remote
Mining. If the route destination is a planet with your mining fleet already in
orbit, the final waypoint task is automatically changed to Merge with Fleet.

Route will not auto-colonize at the destination. You must specify colonization
orders upon the fleet’s arrival.

## RENDEZVOUSING FLEETS

It’s useful to specify one fleet as a destination for another if you are
transferring cargo between fleets (for example, between a remote miner and a
freighter), merging fleets, or chasing an opponent’s fleet.

To rendezvous one fleet with another, just select the current position of the
destination fleet as the waypoint for the fleet that wishes to intercept it. As
long as the destination fleet can be detected by the pursuing fleet’s scanner, this fleet will follow the destination fleet until it overtakes it or runs out of
fuel. If the fleet in pursuit loses sight of the destination fleet, it travels to the
destination fleet’s last known position.
