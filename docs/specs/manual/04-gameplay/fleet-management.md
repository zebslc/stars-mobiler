## ASSEMBLING FLEETS

Each player can have up to 32,000 ships of each design in a fleet, with up to

For some tasks a fleet with a single ship is sufficient. For example, exploration or colonization usually only requires one ship outfitted with the appropriate technology. However, for moving large quantities of minerals around, for defending your planets and for attacking other players it’s very useful to have

You can merge and split fleets as you wish, using the Merge Fleets waypoint task or the Merge and Split buttons in the Command pane. The affected ships

## WARP SPEED

A fleet’s warp speed determines the number of years it takes to reach a waypoint, as well as fuel usage. Actual distance traveled is the square of the warp speed. For example, a fleet traveling at Warp 8 will move up to 64 light

### Maximum Speed

All engines have an absolute maximum speed, a maximum safe speed, a

The absolute maximum speed for all engines is warp 10. The maximum safe speed for most ships is warp 9. You can push your fleet to warp 10, but you’ll have a 10% chance of losing each ship in the fleet at that speed. Only ships using warp 10 capable engines can travel safely at warp 10. You can tell if an engine is warp 10 capable by viewing it in the Technology Browser and seeing if the area between warp 9 and 10 is covered with a yellow warning

For most standard engines the maximum free speed is warp 1. This means that

at less than 120% fuel usage. For Ramscoop engines the best warp speed is the maximum speed that the engine can travel using no fuel. To learn the best speed for a specific engine, visit the Engines section of the Technology Browser. The Fuel Usage vs. Warp Speed graphs in the Browser shows this speed for each engine. The following graph shows that the best warp speed

Any ship can travel Warp 1 without using fuel. This means you travel 1 light year per year of play. You also generate tiny amounts of fuel at Warp 1, and may be able to put on small bursts of speed. This really is helpful only if you’re close to your destination, almost out of fuel, and don’t want to bother

## FINDING A SPECIFIC FLEET

The simplest way to locate a planet or fleet is to use the Find command. Use

To find a fleet of your own, do one of the following: - Enter the fleet number using any format (fleet #58, fleet 58, #58, 58).

To find another player ’s fleet:

race_name fleet #fleet_number

If Stars! says it cannot find a planet or fleet by that name, try again, making sure you type the correct name or number, or that you used the correct format for finding another player ’s fleet. If you still can’t find a fleet, it may no longer


### Ship

1. Select the Scanner pane’s Ship Design Filter. 3. Double-click on the fleets now shown in the Scanner. If more than one fleet is at a location, continue to click. As you click, the fleets will cycle through the Command pane. You can also use the Next or Prev buttons on the Fleet tile, or click in the Fleet report--Reports (Fleets) menu item.

Details for each fleet are listed in the Fleet Composition tile.

## SWITCHING BETWEEN FLEETS

Switch between fleets using one of the following methods: - Use the Find command (CTRL-F), then click on the ship in the Scanner - Press the Prev and Next buttons on the Fleet tile to scroll through all your fleets in the Command pane. The fleets appear in the current sort order of - Click a location where more than one fleet is present. Right-click on the spot and select another fleet from the pop-up list. Alternately, continue to click in the location until the fleet appears in the Fleet tile. - In the Other Fleets Here tile, select a fleet from the dropdown list. - Click on the row for that fleet in the Fleet Summary Report.

## NAMING FLEETS

1. Select the fleet you wish to rename, displaying it in the Fleet tile. 3. Replace the existing text with your own more descriptive label. 4. OK the Rename dialog. The new name appears in the Fleet tile and

You can use either the new name or the fleet number when Finding a fleet. Other players cannot see the names you have given your fleets.

## USING FUEL

### Fuel is a manufactured commodity made of anti-matter and is measured in

milligrams (mg). This means it has little effect on the ship’s mass (and thus, fuel usage). Fuel can only be obtained from starbases with ship building capability or from other fleets. It is also created by ships traveling at their engine’s free speed, by fuel tankers and by ships with Anti-Matter Generators.

Fuel is shared by all ships in a fleet. The fuel capacity of a fleet is the sum of the fuel capacity for each ship in the fleet. The rate at which fuel is used is based partially on the mass of all ships and cargo in the fleet. Fuel usage is also based on the rate at which each ship in the fleet uses fuel at a given speed. All ship types can move at any speed, but they each burn different amounts of fuel to achieve that speed. The total fuel usage for the fleet is the

Ship_fuel_usage = (ship_mass x efficiency x distance / 200 + 9) / 10

Fuel usage between waypoints is shown in the Fleet Waypoints tile. The amount shown for reaching the selected waypoint is always exact.

speed set to Warp 8.

### Sometimes Slowing Down Uses More Fuel

Each year’s travel is a separate jump that uses a finite, countable number of milligrams of fuel. Let’s say that you have a fleet that can travel at warp 5 for 3mg per year of travel. A journey of 100ly would take 4 years and use 12mg of fuel. If you slowed down to warp 4 it would only cost 2mg per year of travel but the journey would take 7 years for a total of 14mg of fuel. This is a

Ramscoop engines draw fuel from surrounding space, allowing them to travel transport. up to a certain speed at no cost. If you load fuel on a fleet using ramscoop engines and set a speed greater than that allowed for free travel, the fleet will travel at the set speed until it runs out of fuel, then slow to the maximum free Speed for Free speed for that ramscoop. Ramscoops generate fuel when traveling at the free Fuel. See the

### ROUTING FLEETS Usage amount

Routing automatically sends fleets from one planet to another. Stargates are used, if they are available. If the destination planet is yours, and it also has a route destination, the fleet will be passed automatically to the next point.

### Routing is most useful in large universes where you are regularly distributing

new ships from specialized production centers to other points in your empire.

### Routing can also be used to send existing fleets from one side of your empire

to the other, specifying only one waypoint within fuel range.

### Routing is a function

production.

To set a planet’s route destination: 1. Click on the Route button in the planet’s Production tile. 2. Move your cursor to the scanner and click on the route destination. A line appears between the origin and destination. Any ship that has route orders will be sent to this destination, as well as any newly built fleet.

To change the route destination: - Click on the Route button, then click on the new destination.

To pass fleets from route destination to route destination: 1. Set a route destination for each planet in your circuit or path. 3. Using the Waypoint Tasks tile, assign the fleet Route orders. When it arrives at a planet with a route destination, it will automatically be passed along. If the planet has a starbase with ship building capability, the fleet is

### Route Behavior

If the route destination is an uncolonized planet and fleet includes remote miners, its orders are automatically changed at the destination to Remote Mining. If the route destination is a planet with your mining fleet already in orbit, the final waypoint task is automatically changed to Merge with Fleet.

Route will not auto-colonize at the destination. You must specify colonization

## RENDEZVOUSING FLEETS

It’s useful to specify one fleet as a destination for another if you are transferring cargo between fleets (for example, between a remote miner and a

To rendezvous one fleet with another, just select the current position of the destination fleet as the waypoint for the fleet that wishes to intercept it. As long as the destination fleet can be detected by the pursuing fleet’s scanner, this fleet will follow the destination fleet until it overtakes it or runs out of fuel. If the fleet in pursuit loses sight of the destination fleet, it travels to the


### How to Pick a Fleet Out From a Crowd

When two or more fleets are at the same location or close together, and you want to send another fleet to meet with one of them, do one of the following: - If the fleets are close together, zoom in using the plus (+) key until you can see everything clearly. Then set the waypoint on the fleet you wish to - If two fleets are in the same location and you wish to target one specifically, or target an opponent’s fleet in orbit, click on the blue diamond in the Fleet Waypoint tile, then select the destination fleet from the pop-up list. - If the goal is to refuel the destination fleet or join with the destination fleet Learn about then you can use the Merge with Fleet waypoint task. This task requires that you specify the destination fleet as the waypoint. Ships, p 14-2

## SPLITTING FLEETS

To split a fleet, click on the Split or Split All button in the Fleet Composition tile. Choose Split to transfer any number of ships between the fleet under command and the fleet selected in the Other Fleets Here tile. Choose Split All to divide all ships in the fleet into separate fleets based on ship design.

You can also merge fleets using the Merge with Fleet waypoint task, located in


### If you would like to transfer some but not all ships between the fleet under

command and a selected fleet at the same location, click on the Merge button

## SCRAPPING FLEETS

### Scrap or destroy a fleet by merging it with a colony fleet or by choosing the Ultimate Recycling

Scrap Fleet waypoint task. Scrapping allows you to regain a percentage of the minerals used in the ship’s construction and all the mineral cargo on board. This is a good way to get rid of ships built using a hull design that is no longer trait recover 90% of useful. You can scrap fleets at any planet or even in deep space.

### The construction minerals you recover are added to the minerals at the planet scrapping at a

where the fleet is scrapped. The percentage of minerals recovered depends on - Scrap Fleet at a starbase — leaves 80% of the minerals used in - Scrap Fleet at any planet without a starbase — leaves 33% of the minerals - Scrap Fleet in deep space — all construction minerals are lost.

### Feeding Scraps to other Players

You can exchange technology with an opponent by scrapping a fleet at the opponent’s planet. The opponent has the same chance of learning the technology as they if they had met you in battle. They also get the recycled minerals and, if they have the Ultimate Recycling trait, they also get
