## SCANNER TECHNOLOGY

Like all other technology, the science behind scanners and
cloaking devices must be researched. The research requirements
and features of planet-based scanners are described in the
Planetary category of the Technology Browser; ship-based
scanners are described in the Scanners category; cloaking devices are
described in the Electrical and other miscellaneous categories.

### Planet-penetrating scanners

These scanners can detect fleets in orbit around a planet. They also can tell
you planetary statistics from a distance, such as mineral concentrations under
the planet surface.

(100^4 + 100^4 + 60^4) ^ ⁄ = 120 light years

The same calculation applies to planet penetrating scanners.

### Scanners and Primary Traits

Some races have extra scanner technology. For example, if you’ve chosen
Packet Physics as your primary trait, all your mineral packets will act as
planet-penetrating scanners. If you choose Space Demolition all your
minefields act as normal scanners.

## SELECTING FLEETS IN THE SCANNER PANE

Fleets in orbit are indicated by a circle around the planet. To select a fleet in
orbit:
1. Right click on the planet in the Scanner pane.
2. Select the enemy fleet from the pop-up list.

Follow the same procedure to select a fleet from a group in deep space.

If you own the ship, it appears in the Command pane.

Estimated Path of Another Player ’s Fleet

Click in the Scanner on an opponent’s fleet to display its estimated path. The
arrow points in the approximate direction of travel. Tick marks appear on the
line indicating how far the fleet will move in a year at its current speed. Since
a fleet travels in a straight line from waypoint to waypoint, you can use this
path to estimate the fleet’s origin and destination.

Using the opponent’s fleet summary and estimated path, you can guess at the
types of activities your wily foe or friend is up to. For example, if you select a
fleet of attack ships, you can meet them in battle, and have a better idea of
where those attack fleets are coming from and thus, where to aim your own
big guns or to lay minefields. If the selected fleets tend to be scouts, miners or
colonists, you’ll have a clue to their current strategy and possible needs.

## SCANNING PLANETS

When you scan an uninhabited planet, you’ll be able to detect the
environment and the concentration of each mineral under the planet surface, but not the minerals stored on the surface. If you attempt to scan a planet
inhabited by an opponent, you can detect only the environment, underground
mineral concentration and an estimate of the population (plus or minus 20%).

If the planet’s starbase has cloaks, the distance at which you can detect the
enemy’s starbase is reduced.

CLOAKING, OR HIDING FROM OPPONENTS’ SCANNERS
Cloaking devices allow you to reduce your opponent’s effective
scanner range in detecting your cloaked fleet or planet. Cloaking
devices do not make your fleet or planet invisible: no matter how
strong the cloak, the object will always be visible to another fleet at the same
location.

Cloaking reduces your opponent’s scanner range by a specific percentage.
The higher the percentage, the more the range is reduced. The maximum              For a description of

displayed in the Fleet Composition tile, except when in small screen mode.

Uncloaked ships are also hidden in a cloaked fleet, although they do reduce
the cloaking percentage.

### Advantage of a Second Cloak

Cloaks are additive. Additional cloaks reduce your fleet’s visibility.

### Types of Cloaks

There are several types of cloaking devices. If your race is based on the Super-
Stealth primary trait, you also have access to cloaked armor—the Depleted          To learn more
Neutronium, a cloaked shield—the Shadow Shield, and one ship-based                 about a specific
cloaked scanner—the Chameleon. Multiple cloaks on the same ship can all            cloak, open the

### Having scanners on as many planets as possible reduces the chance that

cloaked fleets will sneak past. For example, if your opponent has 75%
cloaking, and your scanners normally detect fleets at a range of 200 light
years, your effective scanning range will be reduced to 50 light years. If your
scanners are close together, whether they be planet-based, ship-based, or a

SCAN NI NG AND CLO AKI N G            17-5

combination, you’ll create a gauntlet that opponents’ships aren’t as likely to
sneak through undetected.

Also consider placing sentry ships at uninhabited planets along your border.
They will help prevent any unseen planet-hopping by your opponents. Even if
a ship is cloaked, you will still detect it when it passes by.

### The X series of planet-based scanners and certain ship-based scanners can

detect both fleets in deep space and fleets in orbit. Both these ranges are
affected by cloaking. For example, if you are using a Snooper 250X planet-
based scanner against a 75% cloak, the scanner will have effective ranges of
62 light years and 31 light years. If the ship is in orbit of a planet 32 light
years away, you won’t see it.

With the Scanner’s Radar Overlay turned on, ask yourself: Will there be gaps
in my coverage if each scanner only sees    as far? What about     as far?

### Adjust the percentage to determine what your coverage would be relative to

the cloaking ability of opponents’ships.

For example, select 75% to show how close a fleet with
25% cloaking will need to be before you can detect it.

Keep in mind that a cloak only reduces a scanner’s effectiveness in detecting
the cloaked fleet. It fools the scanner, rather than physically changing it.

### Tachyon Detector

You must have the Inner Strength trait to use this device.

### Each Tachyon Detector reduces the effectiveness of other players cloak by

5%. The reduction is only seen by the fleet carrying the detector. The affect of
multiple detectors is additive. If a fleet has two detectors, the first lowers the

effectiveness of the opponent’s cloak to 95%, the second detector takes the
95% and reduces it almost another 5%, down to 90.2%. This makes it

17-6    PLAYI NG ST ARS !

significantly harder for enemies to sneak past fleets carrying this device. A
great option for ships on regular patrol duty.

When you add a Tachyon Detector to a hull design, the Ship and Starbase
Designer displays other player ’s cloaking effectiveness on the design’s scanner
information line.

### PIRATING USING STEALTH-BASED SCANNERS

You need the Super Stealth primary race trait and a fleet with the Pick Pocket
or Robber Baron scanner to steal cargo from an opponent’s hold. Just set the
opponent’s fleet as a waypoint, then set the Transport order to Load the           Pick Pocket
amount you want to heist. The theft will take place as soon as your pirate fleet
reaches its victim.

You can steal only cargo, not fuel or colonists.
