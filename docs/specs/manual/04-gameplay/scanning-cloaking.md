## SCANNER TECHNOLOGY

Like all other technology, the science behind scanners and cloaking devices must be researched. The research requirements and features of planet-based scanners are described in the scanners are described in the Scanners category; cloaking devices are described in the Electrical and other miscellaneous categories.


### Planet-penetrating scanners

These scanners can detect fleets in orbit around a planet. They also can tell you planetary statistics from a distance, such as mineral concentrations under

These scanners cannot penetrate a planet. Any object orbiting the planet is hidden from your radar. Minefields are cloaked 75% from this type of scanner. Scanners

### Minefields act as

Scanners are Additive The formula for calculating a ship’s scanner range is the 4th root of the sum of Space Demolition each scanner to the 4th power. Let’s say you have a ship design with two 100 (100^4 + 100^4 + 60^4) ^ ⁄ = 120 light years

The same calculation applies to planet penetrating scanners.

### Scanners and Primary Traits

Some races have extra scanner technology. For example, if you’ve chosen Packet Physics as your primary trait, all your mineral packets will act as planet-penetrating scanners. If you choose Space Demolition all your

## SELECTING FLEETS IN THE SCANNER PANE

Fleets in orbit are indicated by a circle around the planet. To select a fleet in

Follow the same procedure to select a fleet from a group in deep space.

Estimated Path of Another Player ’s Fleet

Click in the Scanner on an opponent’s fleet to display its estimated path. The arrow points in the approximate direction of travel. Tick marks appear on the line indicating how far the fleet will move in a year at its current speed. Since a fleet travels in a straight line from waypoint to waypoint, you can use this

Using the opponent’s fleet summary and estimated path, you can guess at the types of activities your wily foe or friend is up to. For example, if you select a fleet of attack ships, you can meet them in battle, and have a better idea of where those attack fleets are coming from and thus, where to aim your own big guns or to lay minefields. If the selected fleets tend to be scouts, miners or colonists, you’ll have a clue to their current strategy and possible needs.

## SCANNING PLANETS

When you scan an uninhabited planet, you’ll be able to detect the environment and the concentration of each mineral under the planet surface, but not the minerals stored on the surface. If you attempt to scan a planet inhabited by an opponent, you can detect only the environment, underground mineral concentration and an estimate of the population (plus or minus 20%).

If the planet’s starbase has cloaks, the distance at which you can detect the


Cloaking devices allow you to reduce your opponent’s effective scanner range in detecting your cloaked fleet or planet. Cloaking devices do not make your fleet or planet invisible: no matter how strong the cloak, the object will always be visible to another fleet at the same

Cloaking reduces your opponent’s scanner range by a specific percentage. The higher the percentage, the more the range is reduced. The maximum amount of cloaking possible is 98%, or a reduction of your opponent’s scanner range by 98%. displayed in the Fleet Composition tile, except when in small screen mode.

Uncloaked ships are also hidden in a cloaked fleet, although they do reduce

### Advantage of a Second Cloak

Cloaks are additive. Additional cloaks reduce your fleet’s visibility.

### Types of Cloaks

There are several types of cloaking devices. If your race is based on the Super- Stealth primary trait, you also have access to cloaked armor—the Depleted Neutronium, a cloaked shield—the Shadow Shield, and one ship-based cloaked scanner—the Chameleon. Multiple cloaks on the same ship can all be of the same or different strengths. Browser (press F2).

Cloaked Starbases DETECTING OPPONENTS’ FLEETS

### Having scanners on as many planets as possible reduces the chance that

cloaked fleets will sneak past. For example, if your opponent has 75% cloaking, and your scanners normally detect fleets at a range of 200 light years, your effective scanning range will be reduced to 50 light years. If your scanners are close together, whether they be planet-based, ship-based, or a


combination, you’ll create a gauntlet that opponents’ships aren’t as likely to

Also consider placing sentry ships at uninhabited planets along your border. They will help prevent any unseen planet-hopping by your opponents. Even if a ship is cloaked, you will still detect it when it passes by.

### The X series of planet-based scanners and certain ship-based scanners can

detect both fleets in deep space and fleets in orbit. Both these ranges are affected by cloaking. For example, if you are using a Snooper 250X planet- based scanner against a 75% cloak, the scanner will have effective ranges of 62 light years and 31 light years. If the ship is in orbit of a planet 32 light

With the Scanner’s Radar Overlay turned on, ask yourself: Will there be gaps in my coverage if each scanner only sees as far? What about as far?

### Adjust the percentage to determine what your coverage would be relative to

the cloaking ability of opponents’ships.

For example, select 75% to show how close a fleet with

Keep in mind that a cloak only reduces a scanner’s effectiveness in detecting the cloaked fleet. It fools the scanner, rather than physically changing it.

### Tachyon Detector

You must have the Inner Strength trait to use this device.

### Each Tachyon Detector reduces the effectiveness of other players cloak by

5%. The reduction is only seen by the fleet carrying the detector. The affect of multiple detectors is additive. If a fleet has two detectors, the first lowers the

effectiveness of the opponent’s cloak to 95%, the second detector takes the 95% and reduces it almost another 5%, down to 90.2%. This makes it


significantly harder for enemies to sneak past fleets carrying this device. A

When you add a Tachyon Detector to a hull design, the Ship and Starbase Designer displays other player ’s cloaking effectiveness on the design’s scanner

### PIRATING USING STEALTH-BASED SCANNERS

You need the Super Stealth primary race trait and a fleet with the Pick Pocket or Robber Baron scanner to steal cargo from an opponent’s hold. Just set the opponent’s fleet as a waypoint, then set the Transport order to Load the amount you want to heist. The theft will take place as soon as your pirate fleet reaches its victim.

You can steal only cargo, not fuel or colonists.
