## ADDING AN ITEM TO THE PRODUCTION QUEUE

You can add an item at any time to any spot in the production queue. The procedure is slightly different depending on whether you want to do the

### Add an Item to the Top of the Queue

1. Click on — Top of the Queue — . 2. Click on an item in the inventory, then click on Add or double-click on


### Add an Item to the Middle of the Queue Adding Large

1. Click on the item in the queue under which you want the new item to appear. 2. Click on an item in the inventory list, then click the Add button, or

### Add an Item to the Bottom of the Queue many of that item

- Click on the last item in the queue, then on an item in the inventory list. also works if you Then click the Add button, or double click on the item in the inventory

### Move an Item in the Queue same when used

1. Click on the item in the queue that you want to move.

## REMOVING AN ITEM FROM THE PRODUCTION QUEUE

Do one of the following:

### SHIFT-Remove

- Select an item in the queue, then click the Remove button or double-click removes up to 10. - Keep clicking the Remove button or double-clicking on the item name to

PRODUCTION TEMPLATES possible. This also

### A production template is a sequence of auto-build items imported from a works if you press

production queue and saved for later use. Use production templates to automate auto-build production strategies you plan to use more than once.

### These keys behave

over or newly colonized by your people. The other three templates can be manually applied to any planet’s production queue. Templates are saved for used with the Add


### You apply templates by simply selecting the template name instead of

manually adding the items to the production queue. When you apply a template, all auto-build items currently in the queue are replaced with the list

### Production Template Strategy

To help illustrate how production templates are useful, here’s an example of a

Defenses (Auto Build) Up to 5

Minimum Terraform Up to 10%

### The planet will work on terraforming first if it is possible and people might die

otherwise. This handles fledgling negative worlds, overcrowding and disasters.

Factories (AB) Up to 10 / Mines (AB) Up to 10


You want constant progress on improving the planet’s productivity. This is

Defenses (AB) Up to 2

### If the planet is doing well enough to complete all those mines and factories

you can afford to work on defenses a bit to keep from falling way behind. Fledgling colonies don’t make it this far.

Factories (AB) Up to 25 / Mines (AB) Up to 25

### At this point we want to ensure the planet has the maximum number of mines

and factories. Only mature planets will reach this point.

Push a mature planet to perfection. The mines and factories are probably maximized for the current population so, if possible, increase the maximum

Defenses (AB) Up to 5

### Add defenses if the colony has the maximum number of mines and factories

possible for the current population.

### Contribute only Leftover Resources

While the colony is fledgling it is a good idea to have “Contribute only leftover resources to research” checked. When the colony reaches the point were the defenses are being auto-built you can deselect the “Contribute only

### Creating a Template

1. Make sure the auto-build items in the queue are arranged in the same 2. Make sure the Contribute only Leftover Resources to Research checkbox


When Contribute Only Leftover... is checked the custom template will include the label Don’t Contribute to Research (until production is complete). Otherwise the template reads Contribute to Research (before 4. Select default or one of the three other template choices. 7. OK the Template dialog. The template is now ready to apply. If you created a default template, it will be applied automatically whenever you

### Manually Applying a Template

Right-click on the blue diamond and select a template to apply to the current production queue. The auto-build items in the template are applied


### Editing a Template

1. Repeat steps 1 & 2 above. 5. Type in a new name for the template if you wish and OK the name

### Renaming or Deleting a Template

1. In the Production dialog, right-click on the blue diamond and select <Customize>. template contents and it’s name or click on Rename and type in a new production queue.

## CLEARING THE PRODUCTION QUEUE

- To remove all items from the production queue click on the Clear button

If the item is removed from the queue before completion, resources and

## UNBLOCKING A PRODUCTION QUEUE


If your planet’s mineral concentration runs so low that the time to completion exceeds 100 years, the item name turns red. This means it will practically never be completed unless you do something about it. You have two choices: transport minerals from other planets or use mineral alchemy (or use a

### Transporting Minerals

To transport minerals, set up freighter waypoints to transport minerals from your remote miners or mineral-rich planets to your planet with the blocked production queue. If you have a mass driver on the needy planet and the mineral-rich planet, you can also fling mineral packets between planets

### Mineral Alchemy

Mineral alchemy transmutes resources into minerals (sort of your own Philosopher’s Stone). If you can’t complete an item in the queue because you’ve run low on one or more minerals, place mineral alchemy in the queue ahead of the item you’re trying to build. Each unit of mineral alchemy will turn a mere 100 of your resources (25 if you have the Mineral Alchemy trait) into 1 kT of each of the three minerals. This is a good strategy for unblocking queues on a planet where you have a large population and can quickly

### Add as many mineral alchemy units as you need to finish the item stuck in

the queue. Like other items in a queue, the color of each Mineral Alchemy task will tell you how long it will take for the process to complete. If you have a large number of resources dedicated to production, you can create a large

Mineral alchemy is one of the items available for auto-building. Consider adding it to your default or a custom production template, if it isn’t already there. If auto-alchemy is placed in front of an item, it will be used only if you have a mineral shortage. If it is the only item in the queue, it will convert resources into minerals until you remove it or place another item immediately

Auto-build items are always in italic, but appear differently in the production

When they’re in the inventory, they are labeled as Auto-build. When you add them to the queue, they are labeled <Item> up to <number>; for example, Factories Up to 50. The latter number indicates that the queue will attempt to

Auto-build Mineral Alchemy is the exception, displaying as Mineral Alchemy as needed. If you insert it in front of an item in the queue you want to perform as much Alchemy as possible to maximize the production rate for that item. If you already have enough minerals, Mineral Alchemy isn’t needed and doesn’t happen. It’s a great insurance policy that always does the right thing. If Alchemy is the last item in the queue, it means to spend all remaining

### Auto-build items can be used to create a default queue for newly colonized

worlds, or for items you wish to produce on any world whenever extra resources are available for production, or when the queue is empty of anything but auto build items. For example, early in the game, it’s useful to continuously build mines and factories. It’s always useful to auto-terraform when conditions are less than perfect and you have the means.

Like any production item, auto build items can be inserted anywhere in the queue. An auto build item stays in the queue until you remove it. This means your production queue will annually attempt to build these items when possible. You can always place other items ahead of auto-build items, or rearrange the items in the queue. Auto build items that cannot be built are


There are, however, differences between the behavior of auto-build items and - Auto-build items do not block the queue. If they cannot be performed, they are skipped over. - Auto-build items are never automatically removed from the queue. They remain there until manually removed and activate only when necessary - You never make progress on auto-build items. When work is done it is seen as a partially completed normal build item in the queue.

Auto-build items include Mines, Factories, Defenses, Mineral Alchemy, Terraforming, and auto-building and flinging Mineral Packets (if you have a

## CHANGING THE ORDER OF PLANETS IN THE PRODUCTION

### DIALOG

You can use the Planet report to change the order in which planets appear in the production dialog. This allows you to easily find the planets that may need upgrades of a specific type (such as starbases) and add the upgrades to 2. Click at the head of any column, choosing a sort that appeals to you. You may want to sort by starbase, by production, mines, factories—anything

### Changing the sort

3. Click in on the Production column to open the queue for that planet.


## CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT PRODUCTION

Page 5 of the View Race dialog tells you if you excel at building and operating factories and mines, as well as how many resources N colonists will generate each year (not counting the resources created by factories). The more each of the following conditions are true, the more your race will excel at - One resource is generated each year for every seven colonists. - Every factory requires five resources (and the usual amount of minerals) to

Of course, the mining rate also affects production. The closer your race is to meeting one or more of the following conditions, the better:

### How Research Makes Production Cheaper

Production of a particular item becomes cheaper when all research requirements are surpassed by one level. For example, an engine requiring research level 3 Propulsion and level 1 Energy becomes 4% cheaper when you attain level 4 Propulsion and level 2 Energy, 16% cheaper with level 7


### Disaster Strikes Planet X!

When comets or other naturally occurring blunt instruments crash into inhabited planets, the planet’s production queue is reset. All work in progress is lost, including the resources spent on that work. It’s not all bad. Usually a cosmic barrage brings extra minerals that you can apply immediately to

8 RESEARCH

You can’t go from rubber band drives to ramscoops or from binoculars to 520X planetary scanners without applying mental elbow grease. This means research. Fortunately, to conduct research in Stars!, you need to know nothing of physics or animal husbandry, biomechanics or elastic waistbands. You only need to know which general areas of technology you wish to research and how many resources you wish to allocate to that research. That, pushing a couple of buttons, and being patient, will gain you access to all the technology you need to rule the known Stars! universe. (press F2). Learn about the types of technology available to your race, the performing a task or items you want to build, and which areas and levels of research are needed to producing an item.
