## ADDING AN ITEM TO THE PRODUCTION QUEUE

You can add an item at any time to any spot in the production queue. The
procedure is slightly different depending on whether you want to do the
following:

### Add an Item to the Top of the Queue

1. Click on — Top of the Queue — .
2. Click on an item in the inventory, then click on Add or double-click on
the item in the inventory list.

### You apply templates by simply selecting the template name instead of

manually adding the items to the production queue. When you apply a
template, all auto-build items currently in the queue are replaced with the list
of items in the template.

### Production Template Strategy

To help illustrate how production templates are useful, here’s an example of a
useful default template for new colonies:

Minimum Terraform Up to 10%
Factories (Auto Build) Up to 10
Mines (Auto Build) Up to 10
Defenses (Auto Build) Up to 2
Factories (Auto Build) Up to 25
Mines (Auto Build) Up to 25
Maximum Terraform Up to 10%
Defenses (Auto Build) Up to 5

Minimum Terraform Up to 10%

### The planet will work on terraforming first if it is possible and people might die

otherwise. This handles fledgling negative worlds, overcrowding and disasters.

Factories (AB) Up to 10 / Mines (AB) Up to 10

PR ODU CT ION       7-5

You want constant progress on improving the planet’s productivity. This is
what fledgling colonies spend most of their time doing.

Defenses (AB) Up to 2

### If the planet is doing well enough to complete all those mines and factories

you can afford to work on defenses a bit to keep from falling way behind.
Fledgling colonies don’t make it this far.

Factories (AB) Up to 25 / Mines (AB) Up to 25

### At this point we want to ensure the planet has the maximum number of mines

and factories. Only mature planets will reach this point.

Maximum Terraform Up to 10%
Push a mature planet to perfection. The mines and factories are probably
maximized for the current population so, if possible, increase the maximum
population and growth rate.

Defenses (AB) Up to 5

### Add defenses if the colony has the maximum number of mines and factories

possible for the current population.

### Contribute only Leftover Resources

While the colony is fledgling it is a good idea to have “Contribute only
leftover resources to research” checked. When the colony reaches the point
were the defenses are being auto-built you can deselect the “Contribute only
…” option.

### Creating a Template

1. Make sure the auto-build items in the queue are arranged in the same
order in which they should appear in the template.                              Auto-build items do
not need to be
consecutively listed
nor do they need to
appear at the top of
the list to work.
2. Make sure the Contribute only Leftover Resources to Research checkbox
is set the way you want it to be reflected in the template.

7-6     PLAYI NG STARS !

When Contribute Only Leftover... is checked the custom template will
include the label Don’t Contribute to Research (until production is
complete). Otherwise the template reads Contribute to Research (before
production begins).
3. Right-click on the blue diamond and select <Customize>.
4. Select default or one of the three other template choices.
5. Click on Import .
6. Type in a name for the template and OK the name dialog.
7. OK the Template dialog. The template is now ready to apply. If you
created a default template, it will be applied automatically whenever you
establish a new colony.

### Manually Applying a Template

Right-click on the blue diamond and select a template to apply to the current
production queue. The auto-build items in the template are applied
underneath the last item currently in the queue.

### Editing a Template

1. Repeat steps 1 & 2 above.
2. Right-click on the blue diamond and select <customize>.
3. Select the template to be edited.
4. Click on Import.
5. Type in a new name for the template if you wish and OK the name
dialog.
6. Click on OK. The edited template is now ready to apply.

### Renaming or Deleting a Template

1. In the Production dialog, right-click on the blue diamond and select          The default

## CLEARING THE PRODUCTION QUEUE
- To remove all items from the production queue click on the Clear button
in the Production dialog or the Production tile.

If the item is removed from the queue before completion, resources and
minerals already spent on the item are lost.

## UNBLOCKING A PRODUCTION QUEUE

7-8    PLAYI NG STARS !

If your planet’s mineral concentration runs so low that the time to completion
exceeds 100 years, the item name turns red. This means it will practically
never be completed unless you do something about it. You have two choices:
transport minerals from other planets or use mineral alchemy (or use a
combination of the two).

### Transporting Minerals

To transport minerals, set up freighter waypoints to transport minerals from
your remote miners or mineral-rich planets to your planet with the blocked
production queue. If you have a mass driver on the needy planet and the
mineral-rich planet, you can also fling mineral packets between planets
without using ships.

### Mineral Alchemy

Mineral alchemy transmutes resources into minerals (sort of your own
Philosopher’s Stone). If you can’t complete an item in the queue because
you’ve run low on one or more minerals, place mineral alchemy in the queue
ahead of the item you’re trying to build. Each unit of mineral alchemy will
turn a mere 100 of your resources (25 if you have the Mineral Alchemy trait)
into 1 kT of each of the three minerals. This is a good strategy for unblocking
queues on a planet where you have a large population and can quickly
replace the resources used by alchemy.

### Add as many mineral alchemy units as you need to finish the item stuck in

the queue. Like other items in a queue, the color of each Mineral Alchemy
task will tell you how long it will take for the process to complete. If you have
a large number of resources dedicated to production, you can create a large
amount of minerals fairly quickly.

Mineral alchemy is one of the items available for auto-building. Consider
adding it to your default or a custom production template, if it isn’t already
there. If auto-alchemy is placed in front of an item, it will be used only if you
have a mineral shortage. If it is the only item in the queue, it will convert
resources into minerals until you remove it or place another item immediately
following.

ADDING AUTO-BUILD ITEMS TO THE QUEUE
Auto-build items are always in italic, but appear differently in the production
inventory and queue.

When they’re in the inventory, they are labeled as Auto-build. When you add
them to the queue, they are labeled <Item> up to <number>; for example, Factories Up to 50. The latter number indicates that the queue will attempt to
produce the stated number of that item every year.

Auto-build Mineral Alchemy is the exception, displaying as Mineral Alchemy
as needed. If you insert it in front of an item in the queue you want to perform
as much Alchemy as possible to maximize the production rate for that item. If
you already have enough minerals, Mineral Alchemy isn’t needed and doesn’t
happen. It’s a great insurance policy that always does the right thing. If
Alchemy is the last item in the queue, it means to spend all remaining
resources on Mineral Alchemy.

### Auto-build items can be used to create a default queue for newly colonized

worlds, or for items you wish to produce on any world whenever extra
resources are available for production, or when the queue is empty of
anything but auto build items. For example, early in the game, it’s useful to
continuously build mines and factories. It’s always useful to auto-terraform
when conditions are less than perfect and you have the means.

Like any production item, auto build items can be inserted anywhere in the
queue. An auto build item stays in the queue until you remove it. This means
your production queue will annually attempt to build these items when
possible. You can always place other items ahead of auto-build items, or
rearrange the items in the queue. Auto build items that cannot be built are
skipped.

7-10    PLAYI NG ST ARS !

There are, however, differences between the behavior of auto-build items and
others in the queue:
- Auto-build items do not block the queue. If they cannot be performed, they are skipped over.
- Auto-build items are never automatically removed from the queue. They
remain there until manually removed and activate only when necessary
and possible.
- You never make progress on auto-build items. When work is done it is
seen as a partially completed normal build item in the queue.

Auto-build items include Mines, Factories, Defenses, Mineral Alchemy, Terraforming, and auto-building and flinging Mineral Packets (if you have a
mass driver).

## CHANGING THE ORDER OF PLANETS IN THE PRODUCTION

### DIALOG

You can use the Planet report to change the order in which planets appear in
the production dialog. This allows you to easily find the planets that may
need upgrades of a specific type (such as starbases) and add the upgrades to
the production queue.
1. Press F3 to open the Planet report.
2. Click at the head of any column, choosing a sort that appeals to you. You
may want to sort by starbase, by production, mines, factories—anything
you wish.

## CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT PRODUCTION

Page 5 of the View Race dialog tells you if you excel at building and
operating factories and mines, as well as how many resources N colonists will
generate each year (not counting the resources created by factories). The more
each of the following conditions are true, the more your race will excel at
production:
- One resource is generated each year for every seven colonists.
- Factories produce 15 resources per year.
- Every factory requires five resources (and the usual amount of minerals) to
build.
- Colonists may operate 25 factories.
- Factories cost one mineral less to build.

Of course, the mining rate also affects production. The closer your race is to
meeting one or more of the following conditions, the better:
- Mines produce 25 kT of minerals per year.
- Every mine requires two resources to build.
- Every 10,000 colonists can operate 25 mines.

### How Research Makes Production Cheaper

Production of a particular item becomes cheaper when all research
requirements are surpassed by one level. For example, an engine requiring
research level 3 Propulsion and level 1 Energy becomes 4% cheaper when             Learn more about
you attain level 4 Propulsion and level 2 Energy, 16% cheaper with level 7         Factories, p 6-5
Propulsion, level 5 Energy, and so on. You can eventually reduce the cost of       Mining, p 13-1
producing some items by 75% (or 80%, if you possess the Bleeding Edge trait,       Research, p 8-1
which decreases costs at a rate of 5% per level instead of the normal 4%).

### Disaster Strikes Planet X!

When comets or other naturally occurring blunt instruments crash into
inhabited planets, the planet’s production queue is reset. All work in progress
is lost, including the resources spent on that work. It’s not all bad. Usually a
cosmic barrage brings extra minerals that you can apply immediately to
production.
