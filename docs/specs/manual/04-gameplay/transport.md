Remember that you can specify another fleet as a waypoint. For example, if
you want to set up a route between a remote mining fleet and one of your
mineral-needy production planets, specify the mining fleet as the first
waypoint and the production planet as the second waypoint. At the first
waypoint, the mining fleet, set Transport orders for each mineral you plan to
load, specifying QuikLoad using the Zip Orders diamond. At the second
waypoint, specify the QuikDrop Transport Zip Order for each type mineral
you load from the miner.

## TRANSFERRING FUEL AND CARGO TO OTHER FLEETS

Fuel and minerals can be transferred between fleets. These fleets can belong
to you or an opponent. Once given, the fuel or cargo cannot be taken back.
This opens up possibilities for trade (as part of a diplomatic strategy).

Fuel and minerals can also be transferred from any player’s fleet to any
player’s planet. However, if one player attempts to transfer colonists to
another player’s planet (regardless of their relationship), that’s called an
invasion, and dealt with in the expected manner.

Transfer cargo using one of the cargo transfer dialogs. These are accessible
from several tiles in the Command pane.

## JETTISONING CARGO

As indicated by the Location tile above, you must be in deep space to jettison
cargo. Jettison if you don’t have enough fuel, must reach your destination or
make a fast getaway, and can’t wait for another ship to reach you with fuel.

TR ANS POR T ING FR E IG HT   14-3

Transferring cargo to an opponent’s ship or a planet you don’t own effectively
does the same thing: you lose the cargo. Jettisoned cargo is lost to the cosmos.

You cannot jettison cargo if there is salvage at the same location.

## CREATING A CUSTOM TRANSPORT ZIP ORDER

### A Zip Order is a common Transport order you wish to specify many times in a

game, just by selecting the Zip Order name. Stars! provides four pre-defined
Zip Orders (including Clear). You can’t change the pre-defined orders, but you
can add up to four custom zip orders.

Once you create a Custom Zip Order, it becomes available in all your games
until you delete it. Here’s how to create one:
1. Specify the Transport order in the Waypoint Task tile.
2. Set up the order you wish to add to the Zip Order list by selecting the
appropriate cargo items and operations.
3. Right-click on the blue diamond in the Waypoint Task tile.
4. Select <Customize> from the pop-up menu. The Custom Zip Orders
dialog appears.
5. Select a Custom Order slot in the dialog.
6. Click on Import . This copies in the current transport orders from the
Waypoint Task tile. The Rename Zip Order dialog appears.

14-4   PLAY I NG ST ARS !
7. Type the name, and OK the dialog. The new order appears in the Custom
Order dialog.
8. OK the Custom Order dialog.
9. Right-click on the blue diamond again. Your custom Zip Order appears in
the pop-up.

### Editing a Custom Zip Order
- Repeat steps 1 - 5 above, and in step 5, select the order you wish to
modify.
- Click on Import and OK the Rename Zip Order dialog.

## FLINGING MINERAL PACKETS

Flinging a mineral packet is a two step process:

Step 1: Target the Mass Driver
This must be done before you build the packets, or the packets will
disintegrate. Of course, you must also have a mass driver on the planet’s
starbase.

### Slower speeds allow you to fling packets to planets with lesser mass drivers

(meaning you want the planet to catch the packet). Packets flung above the
rated speed are unstable but get there quicker and do more damage.

15               THE BASICS OF COMBAT

Here’s how to create and specify battle plans, initiate
all types of combat, and watch a replay of a battle in
space. In general, all you need to know about the
outcome of a battle is described in the message you
receive. If you lose a battle and don’t know why or
just want to compare your tactics to those of your enemies you can watch a
replay of the battle in the battle VCR.

FLEET-TO-FLEET COMBAT
To attack an opponent’s fleet:
1. Choose your fleet’s battle plan, or
view, change or create a battle plan
using the dropdown list in the Fleet
Composition tile.
2. Set a waypoint at the enemy fleet. If
the enemy fleet is in orbit of a planet, you may want to explicitly target the
fleet so you’ll chase it if it leaves the
planet. In this case, just right-click on the blue diamond in the Fleet
Waypoints tile and choose the enemy fleet from the list that displays.

Your fleet will either reach the enemy and engage them, or, if you’re tackling      The outcome is

Battle Orders don’t Interfere with Waypoint Tasks
By default, new armed fleets start out with attack orders. Since these orders
are always in effect, your armed fleets can also be assigned any waypoint task
suitable for that fleet.

### Firing in Passing

If a ship moves in the direction of its primary target but is still out of range, it
will try and fire on any target within range. The primary target is specified in
the Battle Plans dialog.

### Salvage from Space Battles

Ships destroyed in battle or by minefields leave salvage. Cargo is dumped in
space as a mineral packet or, if the battle took place in orbit, the cargo falls to
the surface of the planet. Players who survive a battle against technologically
superior ships have up to a 50% chance of automatically advancing one level
in one field of technology. The technology bonus is based on sensor readings
rather than salvage. In order to recover the minerals from a salvage packet for
use in production:
1. Set the salvage packet as a waypoint (if you aren’t there already).
2. When you arrive, choose the packets from the dropdown list in the Other

3. Click on the Cargo button, then transfer the minerals in the packets to
your cargo holds.

### Reviewing a Space Battle

After a while you will find that there is no need to view most battles. There are times, however, when you were sure that you had overwhelming forces and still got your rear kicked. That’s
where the Battle VCR comes in to play. It is a great place to learn about the characteristics of
your opponents’ fleets and to determine your opponents’ battle strategy.

On the turn following a battle, you receive a message summarizing the event. Click the
Message pane’s Goto button, replacing Goto with View. Click on View to open the VCR.
