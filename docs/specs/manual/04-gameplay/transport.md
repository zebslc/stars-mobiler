## SHIPPING FREIGHT

To get the transport process started:

### Ultimate Recycling

1. Select the fleet that will carry the cargo. 3. In the Fleet Waypoints tile, select the waypoint where you want to load or and just scrap them

### Zip Orders

4. In the Waypoint Task tile, specify the Transport orders:

### Select Transport as the task of the sets of orders

listed. Left-click on

### Select a cargo the diamond for a

Select a load/unload action pre-defined orders.

### You can also create

Repeat this process for each waypoint where you’ll load or unload freight. Zip Orders.


### Repeat Orders

If you want to set up the fleet to endlessly follow a route until you specify For a description of otherwise, check the Repeat Orders box in the Fleet Waypoints tile. If you specify that planet again as a waypoint.

Remember that you can specify another fleet as a waypoint. For example, if you want to set up a route between a remote mining fleet and one of your mineral-needy production planets, specify the mining fleet as the first waypoint and the production planet as the second waypoint. At the first waypoint, the mining fleet, set Transport orders for each mineral you plan to load, specifying QuikLoad using the Zip Orders diamond. At the second waypoint, specify the QuikDrop Transport Zip Order for each type mineral

If you want to set up regular transport routes and you’re playing a large universe, consider using fleet routing to send your ships from planet to planet. Routing Fleets, p 10-7

## TRANSFERRING FUEL AND CARGO TO OTHER FLEETS

Fuel and minerals can be transferred between fleets. These fleets can belong to you or an opponent. Once given, the fuel or cargo cannot be taken back. This opens up possibilities for trade (as part of a diplomatic strategy).

Fuel and minerals can also be transferred from any player’s fleet to any player’s planet. However, if one player attempts to transfer colonists to another player’s planet (regardless of their relationship), that’s called an

Transfer cargo using one of the cargo transfer dialogs. These are accessible

## JETTISONING CARGO

As indicated by the Location tile above, you must be in deep space to jettison cargo. Jettison if you don’t have enough fuel, must reach your destination or make a fast getaway, and can’t wait for another ship to reach you with fuel.

TR ANS POR T ING FR E IG HT 14-3

Transferring cargo to an opponent’s ship or a planet you don’t own effectively does the same thing: you lose the cargo. Jettisoned cargo is lost to the cosmos.

You cannot jettison cargo if there is salvage at the same location.

## CREATING A CUSTOM TRANSPORT ZIP ORDER

### A Zip Order is a common Transport order you wish to specify many times in a

game, just by selecting the Zip Order name. Stars! provides four pre-defined Zip Orders (including Clear). You can’t change the pre-defined orders, but you

## FLINGING MINERAL PACKETS

Flinging a mineral packet is a two step process:

This must be done before you build the packets, or the packets will disintegrate. Of course, you must also have a mass driver on the planet’s

### Mass driver

1. Click on the Set Dest button on the Starbase tile. The Scanner displays the path as a purple line.


### Slower speeds allow you to fling packets to planets with lesser mass drivers

(meaning you want the planet to catch the packet). Packets flung above the rated speed are unstable but get there quicker and do more damage.

For the packet to arrive safely, the target must also have a driver of equal or Interstellar

Select the packets you want to build, then Add them to the queue. Your planet will build and fling packets until you remove the item from the mineral packets. scanner range appear in the Scanner as a green square if they belong to you or a red square if they belong to an opponent.

### Salvage from Space Battles

Ships destroyed in battle or by minefields leave salvage. Cargo is dumped in space as a mineral packet or, if the battle took place in orbit, the cargo falls to the surface of the planet. Players who survive a battle against technologically superior ships have up to a 50% chance of automatically advancing one level in one field of technology. The technology bonus is based on sensor readings rather than salvage. In order to recover the minerals from a salvage packet for 1. Set the salvage packet as a waypoint (if you aren’t there already). 2. When you arrive, choose the packets from the dropdown list in the Other

After a while you will find that there is no need to view most battles. There are times, however, when you were sure that you had overwhelming forces and still got your rear kicked. That’s where the Battle VCR comes in to play. It is a great place to learn about the characteristics of your opponents’ fleets and to determine your opponents’ battle strategy.

On the turn following a battle, you receive a message summarizing the event. Click the Message pane’s Goto button, replacing Goto with View. Click on View to open the VCR.
