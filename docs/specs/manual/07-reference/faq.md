QUESTIONS
IS ANYONE OUT THERE?

Do the AIs (computer players) cheat?

Stars! is one of the few games where computer players do not cheat. The
Stars! AIs are governed by the same code that governs human players, and
receive the same information. Expert level AIs start with more race design
advantage points than human players —that is the only difference. If you feel
like you've been taken advantage of by an AI, let us know. We'll investigate
and, if we find that the AI does have an unfair advantage, we'll take it behind
the woodshed.

Will anyone listen if I have feedback for the authors?

### IIf you didn't like something in particular or experience problems with the

game, or if you have good ideas for the game, please let us know. We answer
all our mail and value your feedback -- if it's something we can help you
with, we will. If it's just a matter of not having a feature you want, let us know
that, too -- it just might show up in the next version.

When you submit your ideas, please keep in mind that Stars! is turn-based, not real-time.

How do I get player and technical support?

If you haven't used the tutorial, you should take a run through it. You can
learn a lot about game play there even if you aren't just starting out. The
online player's guide (help) contains detailed documentation about virtually

every aspect of the game.

If these resources don't yield answers to your questions, you can send e-mail
to support@webmap.com, or visit these web pages:

How do I submit bug reports?
1. Write a description of the suspected bug in a text file.
2. Zip all the relevant game files and the text file:

pkzip gamename.zip gamename.* backup\gamename.* bugnotefile
3. Send us the zip file in one of the following ways:

Mail the zip file to bugstars@webmap.com along with a description of the
problem, or...
FTP the zip file to beast.webmap.com/pub. Be sure to send e-mail to
bugstars@webmap.com with a description of the problem and the name
of the zip file uploaded.
We appreciate the time and effort it takes to send these files. It helps us a
great deal to have the actual game files when trying to determine if a bug
exists. Thanks for taking the time to help Stars! maintain it's reputation as one
of the most stable and bug-free games on the market.

When I zip my game files, they don't get any smaller. Why not?

Stars! game files are already compressed.

## DIFFERENT STROKES

Can several people play on the same computer using one copy?

Yes. Up to 16 people can play "hot-seat" on the same computer with one
copy of Stars!. Just make sure that all players use the same copy. In other
words make sure that there is only one copy of the game running.

To play one game with several players on one machine:

FRE Q UE NT LY ASK ED Q U EST IO NS           D-3

METHOD 1

Each player can submit their turn, saves, and then goes back to the splash
screen using File (Close). You don't have to exit Stars! between players.

METHOD 2

If you have enough memory (about 2-4MB per player depending on the
universe size) you can run multiple instances of the game. An "instance" is
one running session of the game.

For Setup and Play details, see Chapter 2, Multi-Player Setup.

Can two or more people using the same machine, submit turns in the same
e-mail game?

Yes. When your .x# file is created it is marked with both your serial number

and a fingerprint of your machine. The host will only penalize two or more
people playing with the same serial number and DIFFERENT machine
fingerprints. Any number of people can submit turns from the same machine
with the same serial number. If however, you had two machines at home and
submitted one .x# file from each, then each one must have a unique serial

number. This allows you to do cool things like take a friend's turn for them
when they're out of town or have two family members play from the same
machine and so on. We have tried to make sure that our copy protection
mechanism is as non-intrusive as possible.

Where can I find hosted games and other players?

WWW Host Sites:

Visit the Stars! website at http://www.webmap.com/stars!. You’ll find a
waypoints page which lists a number of Stars! sites where you can join games
and find player resources.                                                     Learn about:

A HOST’S WORK IS NEVER DONE

Is it possible to Host Stars! in DOS?

FR EQ U EN TLY AS K ED QU EST I O NS            D-4

It depends. If the machine cannot run Windows, then the answer is No. If the
machine can run Windows but usually does not, then the answer is Yes. It is
possible to launch Windows and Stars! from a DOS batch file in such a way
that Stars! will generate turns for one or more games and then exit all the way
out of Windows allowing the batch file to continue where you it left off.

Why is there any way for a host to retrieve a lost password?

### Any utility which allowed hosts to remove or change passwords would

remove all security from the game. All an unscrupulous host would have to
do is copy the game files to another directory and remove the passwords from
the player's files in that directory. They could then look at everybody's data in
that copy of the universe and no matter what Stars! did, the real players
would never know. In a network game ANY player could pull the same trick.
Security is an all or nothing element. If we didn't provide at least the minimal
level of security we do now, multi-player Stars! games would be a joke.

I have multiple licenses. How do I restore a turn ruined by installing the
wrong serial number on a machine?

### All you have to do is copy the game files from the backup directory to the

game directory, open each affected player's turn and choose File (Save). This
will save their .x# files with the correct serial numbers and machine IDs.

## RACE DESIGN

How do I create and save a custom race?

Read Chapter 20 on Designing Custom Races.

Is there an ultimate race?

### It depends on the type of universe and the placement and experience of the

other players. Expert players can make any race an ultimate race (a few
people have proven this). However, the same "ultimate race" in that game
might get stomped into space dust in another game with a less hospitable mix
of variables. Success breeds predictability.

Can I edit a race during play?

Once a game is started, you're stuck with the race you entered the game with.

FR EQ UE NT LY ASK ED QU EST IO NS   D-5

### All game files are compressed and encrypted to provide security for all

players. Players cannot read or modify data files.

You can however, at any time, open a saved race file (including the file for a
race currently in play) and make edits. As you are playing a race, you might
discover a weakness you would like to correct for the next time you play that
race.

To edit a race, open the race file using the File (Open) menu item. Read
Chapter 20 on Designing Custom Races for more information.

WHILE I’M PLAYING

Can I design my own ship hulls?

You can design elaborate ship configurations, but you can't design your own
hulls. This is a primary game-balancing restriction.

Can I use diplomacy in Stars!?

### Stars! has features that allow you to practice simple diplomacy in multi-player

games.

Use the Message pane to communicate with other players, arranging such
things as alliances, rendezvous, trade agreements and non-aggression pacts.

When you're setting up the game, you can specify winning conditions that
encourage diplomacy by allowing for multiple winners. Stars! does not
require one winner.

You can declare neutral and friendly players using the Player Relations dialog.

### This prevents you from attacking the wrong people and allows you to

automatically come to a friend's aid if they're under fire. Friends can also pass
through each other's mine fields without harm. So it's worth while to set up
alliances, even if they're temporary.

How can I print out a star chart of the universe?

Use the File ( Print Map) menu item.
