## C                FILES USED IN STARS!

HOST FILE — GAMENAME.HST

### This is the file containing the information the host program needs for a

specific game. This file should be available only to the person playing the
host.

UNIVERSE FILE — GAMENAME.XY
This is the universe file, containing information about the positions of all the
planets. It does not change over the course of the game. Individual players as
well as the host program need to have this file available to them.

TURN FILE — GAMENAME.MN
These are the turn files. N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the player
number. This is the individual file for each player, containing all the data
about that player’s race and state of the player’s empire at the beginning of a
turn.

RACE DESCRIPTION FILE — NAME.RN FILES

### This file contains a race description created and saved using the Custom Race

Wizard. N can be any number (you can actually use any extension, the
default is r1.) You can specify a race file for each non-computer player in the    The extension of .r1
game from step 2 of the New Advanced Game dialog. Once the universe has            is the default, and is
been created the race file is no longer needed. If you open this file using File   not required.
(Open), the Custom Race Wizard opens.

LOG FILE —- GAMENAME.XN
These are the log files. N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the player
number. This is the log of orders given by a player for the current turn. This
file is submitted, either automatically or manually, to the host program. The
host adds the changes to the player’s .mN file, and returns that file to the
player when the new turn is generated. The host needs these files to update
the information about each player from the .hst file before turn generation.

Each time the player opens (or continues) a game, the .mN file is loaded. If a
corresponding log file exists, it will also be loaded to update the game’s
current state.

HISTORY FILE —- GAMENAME.HN
These are history files. N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the player
number. This file is created by the player as he sees universe data. It is a
history of the things the player has seen or learned on previous turns.
Typically, only the player maintains a copy of this file. If a player will be
absent for a few turns, and wishes to be temporarily replaced by the
Housekeeper AI, a copy of this file should be given to the host so the absent
player’s view of the universe can be updated.

If this file is lost, corrupted or moved to another directory, the player will not
see what’s been done in past turns.

INI FILE — STARS.INI
The stars.ini file is located in the windows directory. Stars! stores player
options and current game information in this file. Most of the items in the file
have to do with relatively unimportant stuff like the arrangement and
windows, the current scanner view and overlays.

The following items in the stars.ini are user changeable:

### Default Password

Set the password in the [Misc] section of stars.ini:

DefaultPassword=Foo
Where Foo is whatever password you generally use. If you are sure that your
opponents will not have access to your stars.ini file you can set this to your

FILES USE D IN STA RS !            C-3

password. Whenever you open a game file that is protected by this password
you will not be prompted to enter it.

### Number of Backup Directories

Set this option in the [Misc] section of stars.ini:

Backups=N
Where N is a number between 1 and 999. Backup directories will be named
Backup1 to BackupN and old game files will be stored there according to the
turn number. For example with backups=4 then the first turn would be backed
up to the directory backup1, the second to backup2, the third to backup3, the
fourth to backup4, the fifth to backup1 and so on.

By default Stars! saves one previous turn’s data in a directory it creates named
Backup.

### When the ini file is Written

The stars.ini file is written the first time you play Stars and save a game. If you   Learn about:
start Stars! and exit from the splash screen without saving a game, the file isn’t    Stars! Copy
written. You can delete this file, if you find a need. This will cause Stars! to      Protection, p 4-7
ask for your serial number again, however. An absent ini file is just one of the
conditions that causes Stars! to ask you for your serial number.
