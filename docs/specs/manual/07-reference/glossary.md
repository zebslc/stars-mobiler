## GLOSSARY

### ADDED COST OF RESEARCH

The added cost of research represents the cost of such things as
dilution of research efforts across more than one field, ramp up time
to switch to entering a new fields of study, etc.

AI
An AI is a computer player. AIs always exist in single player games
and can exist in multi-player games, if chosen.

## AIS AND ADVANTAGE POINTS

### The easy AIs receive substantially fewer advantage points than you

do. The expert AIs receive more advantage points than you. The
Standard and Hard AIs fall somewhere in between.

## ANNUAL GROWTH RATE

### This rate is calculated by multiplying the habitability value by the

Maximum Colonist Growth Rate Per Year found on page 4 of the
View Race dialog. For races with the Hyper-Expansion trait the actual
maximum colonists growth rate is twice that displayed.

## BATTLE SPEED

In computing movement in battle, the best speed for all engines is the
figure for 120% fuel usage.

GL-2   B ACK O F TH E B OO K

## BEST WARP SPEED

### This is the maximum warp speed that the engines on this ship design

can go at 120% normal fuel consumption or less. For Ramscoop
engines it is the maximum speed the engine can travel withut using
fuel. This number appears in the Fleet Composition tile for the
selected fleet.

This speed appies only to travel between waypoints, not battle.

## CAPITAL SHIP

A ship with a power rating of at least 2000.

## COLLATERAL DAMAGE

Damage taken by shield of targeted ships when torpedoes miss.

## DEFENSES AND INVADING TROOPS

Defense percentage values are based on the installation’s
effectiveness against bombs. Planetary defenses are 75% effective
against invading troops.

## DISENGAGING

The token attempts to get out of battle (jump into hyperspace). It does
not try to leave the square. Eventually, it will simply disappear from
the board. Hopefully this means it has escaped and not been
liberated to its component quarks.

## ENERGY SOURCES FOR STARSHIPS

### Standard starship engines use anti-matter created at starbases while

Ramscoops simply scoop fuel from the surrounding universe

## FACTORY

Factories produce resources. Resources are units of work created by
people and factories for use in production, research and other tasks.

GLO S SAR Y   GL-3

## FIBONACCI SERIES

Fibonacci numbers are the unending sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ... where each term is defined as the sum of its two
predecessors.

## FLEET COLORS

A blue fleet belongs to you. A red fleet belongs to an opponent. A
purple fleet indicates that both your fleet and an opponent’s fleet are
in the same, or nearly the same, location.

## HOST FILE

gamename.hst — This is the file containing the information the host
program needs for a specific game. This file should be available only
to the person playing the host. If the file is password-protected, you
will be asked for a password.

## INITIATIVE

Initiative determines order of firing in battle. The ship with the highest
initiative fires first.

## LOAD OPTIMAL

Transport order. Load no more fuel than you need to reach the next
waypoint. This option can only calculate the amount of fuel required
for one waypoint. It will not attempt to load enough fuel to get you
beyond your next waypoint.

## MAXIMUM SHIP DESIGNS AND SHIPS

16 different ship designs at one time, and up to 32,000 ships of each
design in a fleet.

## MINE

Mines bring minerals to the surface of your planets, where they are
used in production.

GL-4   B ACK O F TH E B OO K

## MINERAL ALCHEMY

You will be able to turn resources into minerals. One instance of
mineral alchemy will use 100 resources to produce one kT of each
mineral - or only 25 resources for players with the Mineral Alchemy
trait. This item will be available in the production inventory and can
be automated through the auto build feature of the production dialog.

## MOVEMENT

Movement is speed in battle ranging from fi square to 2 fi squares per
round.

## ORBIT RING COLORS

A white circle indicates that one or more of your fleets are in orbit. A
red circle indicates one or more of an opponent’s fleets. A purple
circles indicates that both your fleet(s) and an opponent’s fleet(s) are
in orbit.

PLANET-PENETRATING SCANNERS
These scanners can detect fleets in orbit around a planet. They also
can tell you planetary stats from a distance.

## PLAYER LOG FILE

gamename.mN —- N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the
player number. This is the individual file for each player, containing
all the data about that player’s race and state of the player’s empire at
the beginning of a turn. Both the player and the host maintain copies
of this file.

You can load the current turn in a game by opening the .m file which
has your player number in the extension. If the file is password-
protected, you will be asked for a password.

## RACE FILE

name.rN — This file contains a race description created and saved
using the Custom Race wizard. If you open this file from File (Open),

GLO S SAR Y   GL-5

the Custom Race wizard. If the file is password-protected, you will be
asked for a password. The .r extension is not required for a race file, so you may open race files saved using a different extension as well.

## RATING

A ship’s rating is a relative value of its offensive capability. They are
useful only for general comparison of similar ship designs to help you
decide which design might be more effective in battle.

RACE DESCRIPTION FILE — NAME.RN FILES

### This file contains a race description created and saved using the

Custom Race Wizard. N can be any number (you can actually use
any extension, the default is r1.) If you open this file from File (Open), the Custom Race Wizard opens, allowing you to view or change the
race’s attributes.

The extension of .r1 is the default, and is not required.

## RESOURCES

Resources are units of work created by people and factories. They
represent the effort involved in performing a task or producing an
item.

## ROUND OF BATTLE

Battles last up to 16 rounds. One round of battle is each token getting
a chance to move and fire. A round is broken into phases, where one
phase is a single token moving and, if applicable, firing.

## SHIP CLASSES

Unarmed ships — any design that has no weapons and poses no
threat.

Utility ships – unarmed ship that pose a threat (a subset of Unarmed
ships).

Scouts — ships based on the Scout, Super Scout, and Destroyer hulls.

GL-6   B ACK OF TH E BO O K

Warships — all other armed ships, including armed freighters.

Bomber — any ship based on one of the Bomber hulls.

## TOKEN

Each token is a stack of identical ships from a single fleet.
