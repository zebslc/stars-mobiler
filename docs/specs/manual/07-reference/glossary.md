## GLOSSARY

### ADDED COST OF RESEARCH

The added cost of research represents the cost of such things as dilution of research efforts across more than one field, ramp up time

An AI is a computer player. AIs always exist in single player games

## AIS AND ADVANTAGE POINTS

### The easy AIs receive substantially fewer advantage points than you

do. The expert AIs receive more advantage points than you. The Standard and Hard AIs fall somewhere in between.

## ANNUAL GROWTH RATE

### This rate is calculated by multiplying the habitability value by the

Maximum Colonist Per Year found on page 4 of the View Race dialog. For races with the trait the actual

## BATTLE SPEED

In computing movement in battle, the best speed for all engines is the


## BEST WARP SPEED

### This is the maximum warp speed that the engines on this ship design

can go at 120% normal fuel consumption or less. For Ramscoop engines it is the maximum speed the engine can travel withut using fuel. This number appears in the Fleet Composition tile for the

This speed appies only to travel between waypoints, not battle.

## CAPITAL SHIP

## DISENGAGING

The token attempts to get out of battle (jump into hyperspace). It does not try to leave the square. Eventually, it will simply disappear from

## ENERGY SOURCES FOR STARSHIPS

### Standard starship engines use anti-matter created at starbases while

Ramscoops simply scoop fuel from the surrounding universe

## FACTORY

Factories produce resources. Resources are units of work created by people and factories for use in production, research and other tasks.

## MAXIMUM SHIP DESIGNS AND SHIPS

16 different ship designs at one time, and up to 32,000 ships of each

## MINE

Mines bring minerals to the surface of your planets, where they are


## MINERAL ALCHEMY

You will be able to turn resources into minerals. One instance of mineral alchemy will use 100 resources to produce one kT of each mineral - or only 25 resources for players with the Mineral Alchemy trait. This item will be available in the production inventory and can be automated through the auto build feature of the production dialog.

## MOVEMENT

Movement is speed in battle ranging from fi square to 2 fi squares per

## ORBIT RING COLORS

A white circle indicates that one or more of your fleets are in orbit. A red circle indicates one or more of an opponent’s fleets. A purple circles indicates that both your fleet(s) and an opponent’s fleet(s) are

## PLAYER LOG FILE

gamename.mN —- N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the player number. This is the individual file for each player, containing all the data about that player’s race and state of the player’s empire at the beginning of a turn. Both the player and the host maintain copies

the Custom Race wizard. If the file is password-protected, you will be asked for a password. The .r extension is not required for a race file, so you may open race files saved using a different extension as well.

## RATING

A ship’s rating is a relative value of its offensive capability. They are useful only for general comparison of similar ship designs to help you

RACE DESCRIPTION FILE — NAME.RN FILES

### This file contains a race description created and saved using the

Custom Race Wizard. N can be any number (you can actually use any extension, the default is r1.) If you open this file from File (Open), the Custom Race Wizard opens, allowing you to view or change the
