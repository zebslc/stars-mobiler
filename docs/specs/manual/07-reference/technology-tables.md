## B                TECHNOLOGY TABLES

### These tables list statistics on each piece of technology available in Stars! Use the following guide

to determine the unit of measure for a statistic:
If the category is a technology, such as Energy, the unit is in levels of technology successfully
researched.
If the category is weight or a mineral name, the unit is in kilotons (kT).
DP or Dmg measure damage in points or percentage to a hull, people or surface installations.
Range is number of squares on the battle board (displayed in the VCR).
Fuel # indicates the percentage of standard fuel usage for that engine at the warp speed indicated

by the number.
Ability refers to different things for each type of technology. For a description of an ability, open
the Technology Browser and view the page for that item.
