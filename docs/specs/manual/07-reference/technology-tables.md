## B TECHNOLOGY TABLES

### These tables list statistics on each piece of technology available in Stars! Use the following guide

to determine the unit of measure for a statistic: If the category is a technology, such as Energy, the unit is in levels of technology successfully If the category is weight or a mineral name, the unit is in kilotons (kT). DP or Dmg measure damage in points or percentage to a hull, people or surface installations. Range is number of squares on the battle board (displayed in the VCR). Fuel # indicates the percentage of standard fuel usage for that engine at the warp speed indicated

by the number. Ability refers to different things for each type of technology. For a description of an ability, open
