Player #1’s file is

example, redstar.m1).
4. Tell each player their number. They’ll need it to open the correct file at
the start of their turn.
5. You’ll be prompted for a game name. Enter any name up to eight
characters long (don’t worry about typing an extension). Stars! creates a
set of files containing data for that game and each player in the game.
You can save the game wherever you wish. By default, Stars! will save the
game files in the Stars! install directory.
6. The Stars! Host Mode dialog appears. Create a password, if you want to
prevent other players from opening the game file. Click on Auto Generate
to start the game.
7. Help the players understand what they need to do using the instructions
in What Each Player Needs to Do. If you’re playing as well as hosting, you’ll probably find it easier to start a second instance of Stars!, playing
from one and using the other to handle host duties.

SETTING UP NETWORK-BASED MULTI-PLAYER GAMES
In a multi-player game, designate one person as the host. This person is in
charge of generating turns and generally administering the game. A player can
also act as host.

What the Host Needs to Do (Network Play)
You will need to set up the game in a shared directory (sharepoint) accessible
to all players. This sharepoint is the place that will contain all the game files, and where the players will go to open their games. The sharepoint can exist
on a local area network, or via a modem connection (if you are using
Windows 95 Dial-up Networking capabilities—just connect to the server
machine or to another Win95 machine with the Plus Pack installed). You can
also create network connections using PC-NFS or any other software that
allows you to attach directories on the remote server as if they were local.

Before you begin setup, have your players design their races and give you the
race files for loading into the game. Alternately, you can customize a race for      Learn about

Races.
1. Create the sharepoint that will contain all the game files. We recommend
keeping it simple—no more than one play directory per game, for all
players in the game. You can create this directory within the directory
containing the stars!.exe program, or anywhere else you wish.
2. Click on New Game on the opening screen or on File (New) from the
Stars! main menu. The New Game dialog appears.
3. Click on Advanced Options, then specify options such as the universe

becomes part of the turn filename for each player.
4. Tell each player their number. They’ll need it to open the correct turn file.
5. You’ll be prompted for a game name. Enter any name up to eight
characters long (don’t worry about typing an extension). Stars! creates a
set of files containing data for that game and each player in the game.
Save the game in the shared directory.
6. Select Auto Generate in the Host dialog. The dialog will minimize, waiting for all players to submit their turns. Stars! automatically submits
any turn into the shared directory. Once that’s done, Stars! automatically
generates a new turn, then returns to wait mode.
7. If you want to force a new turn to be generated, double-click on the Stars!
host icon, then select Generate Now from the Host dialog. To cause Stars!
to auto-generate turns again, select Auto Generate again. The dialog will
minimize and wait for players as before. Stars! will continue to follow any
existing orders for players who didn’t submit their turns on time. All
messages and data for the missed turns, such as planets discovered or
battles fought, will be present when they load the new turn.
8. Help the players understand what they need to do using the following
instructions in What Each Player Needs to Do (Network Play). If you’re
playing as well as hosting, you’ll probably find it easier to start a second

a set of files containing data for that game and each player in the game.
You can save the game wherever you wish. By default, Stars! will save the
game files in the Stars! install directory.

4. The Stars! Host dialog appears. Click on Close to stop the game until all
players have submitted their turns. If you’d like to leave Stars! running, click on Auto Generate.
5. Before the first turn each player needs to download the universe file, gamename.xy, and their player file, gamename.mN (where N is the player
number), for the newly created game. Alternately, you can upload or e-
mailgamename.xy and gamename.mN to each player. These files will be
located in the same directory in which you saved the game.
6. Help the players understand what they need to do using the instructions
in the following section on What Each Player Needs to Do
(Modem/FTP/E-mail Play). If you’re playing as well as hosting, you’ll
probably find it easier to start a second instance of Stars!, playing from
one and using the other to handle host duties.

After each player has sent you their turn (in the form of the log file, gamename.xN) do the following:
1. Place each player’s submitted log file in the directory where you set up
the game.
2. Start Stars! (if it’s not already running), click on Open Game, and open
the host file, gamename.hst.
3. If the Stars! host is set to auto-generate mode, it will automatically
generate the new turn as soon as you move the player log files into the
game directory. If you’re generating turns manually, then select Generate
Now from the Host dialog. Stars! will continue to follow any existing
orders for players who didn’t submit their turns on time. All messages and
data for the missed turns, such as planets discovered or battles fought, will be present when they load the new turn.
4. Once the turn is generated, notify the players that the new turn is
available. You can e-mail or upload each newly updated gamename.mN
file or allow each player to download it themselves.

What Each Player Needs to Do (Modem/FTP/E-mail Play)
(Optional) Before the host creates a game, use Stars! Custom Race wizard to
create a customized race, then give the race file to the host.

Once the host creates the game, do the following on the machine where
you’ll play:

MULT I- PLAY ER SET U P   3-9
1. Obtain the gamename.xy and gamename.mN files from your host, where
gamename is the name entered by the host in the File Save dialog and N
is your player number; for example, nonstop.m1.

Place these files in a playing directory you’ve created on your own
system. Use the same directory for each turn. You can create a unique
play directory for each game, or put all games into one directory.
Whatever your strategy, we recommend that you keep it simple.
2. Start Stars! and click on Open Game from the opening screen. Open your
player file, gamename.mN.

Your game begins, with your home world displayed on the screen and in
the Command, Scanner and Selection Summary panes. For the first turn, the Message pane contains tips that help you get started. Investigate your
home planet, start basic production and research, and send your scouts
out to learn about the nearby worlds.
3. Select File (Save and Submit ), then File (Exit). Or, if you’re trading turns
quickly or leave your computer on for long periods of time, you can also
use Turn (Wait for New )—a much simpler scenario.

If you wish, you can exit the game before or after you finish the turn. You
can save your changes or start the turn again if you don’t like the way
things are going. Read Exiting the Game on page 4-4 for more
information.
4. Upload or e-mail only your log file, gamename.xN file to the host system.

If you plan to be absent for more than a few turns, follow the instructions in
Being Absent from Play on page 3-10.

## SETTING AND VIEWING WINNING CONDITIONS

You can specify one or more winning conditions in step 3 of the Advanced
New Game wizard. You can also accept the default conditions provided by
Stars!. To view the winning conditions once the game has begun, choose the
View (Race) menu item, then turn to page 3 of the View Game Parameters
dialog that appears.

Because you can control the variety and combination of winning conditions, more than one player can be declared the winner. All players are notified in a
message when someone wins. You can continue to play past this point, or end
the game.

Track the score using Reports (Score) menu item (or by pressing F10). The
Score sheet shows your score and current ranking, and a history of scores
since the game began.

## ADDING EXPANSION PLAYERS

If you think there’ll be other players joining later in the game, add an
Expansion Player for each missing person. Stars! will assign a housekeeper AI
to run things for those players until they actually join the action. This AI will
keep planets and fleets active, making sure the production queues are busy, etc. It does not develop any strategy.

MU LT I- PLAY ER SET U P   3-11

When the player joins, right click in the Host dialog on the diamond next to
their name and change the type to Human Controlled. Then, give the
latecomer a break by asking the other players to leave them alone for N years.

## BEING ABSENT FROM PLAY

When you miss a turn, Stars! will continue to follow your existing orders. All
messages and data for the missed turns, such as planets discovered or battles
fought, will be present the next time you load a turn.
Alternately, if you plan on missing more than a few turns, you can ask the
host to substitute a housekeeper AI to keep your planets and fleets active. This
AI does not develop any strategy for you.

Hot-seat and network players:
- Just tell the host you’re going inactive and ask them to substitute the AI in
your place.

Modem, e-mail or BBS players only:
1. Give your host a copy of your history file, gamename.hN. This will allow
the host to update the universe for you while you’re gone.
2. Be sure that your host returns the history file and new turn file to you
before you open your game. You won’t be able to open your turn until
this time.

What the host needs to do:
1. Open the Host dialog, if it’s not open yet. Use File (Open), selecting
gamename.hst.
2. Right-click on the blue diamond next to the name of the player who’s
absent. Choose Human (Currently inactive ).
3. When the player returns, right-click on the diamond and select Human
Controlled . You’ll have to do this before the player can open their player
file, gamename.mN.
4. If you’re running the game over a modem, e-mailor BBS, return the
updated history file, gamename.hN, and player file, gamename.mN, to
the player.

FINDING MULTI-PLAYER GAMES ON THE INTERNET
If you want to join a multi-player game, or start your own, but can’t find other
players, visit the Stars! Web site, Waypoint Zero, at www.webmap.com/stars! .
Read the web pages on Player Resources for a list of host sites (growing
weekly) and other host and player information.

## PASSWORDS

### Create or change a password for the current game using the Commands

(Change Password) menu item.

### You can create a default game password using the following option in the

[Misc] section of stars.ini file:

DefaultPassword=<password>

<password> is the password you wish to use. If you are sure that your
opponents will not have access to your stars.ini file you can set this to your
password. Whenever you open a game file that is protected by this password
you will not be prompted to enter it. If DefaultPassword is not present in
stars.ini, type it in under the [Misc] heading.

The stars.ini file is written into your Windows directory the first time you save
a Stars! game. It doesn’t exist before that time.

Don’t Forget Your Password
If you forget or lose your password, there is nothing you can do to open the
password-protected game. We hope you’re not reading this because you’ve
forgotten. Don’t worry, empires come, empires go.

### Inactive Players and Passwords

There is no valid password for inactive players. When the player becomes
active again, they get their old password back.

USING A TIMER APPLICATION?
If you use a timer application to launch Stars! on the host system, take a look
at the variety of command line options on page 4-5. These options will do
such things as start Windows and Stars!, generate the new turn and exit both
programs.
