# Racial Traits System

## Overview

The Racial Traits system is the foundation of Stars!' replayability and strategic depth. Each species must select **one Primary Racial Trait (PRT)** and can have multiple **Lesser Racial Traits (LRTs)** that fundamentally alter their gameplay experience. These traits determine which ship components are available, providing exclusive abilities or imposing restrictions that create distinct playstyles for each species.

The trait system is fully data-driven and integrated into the component filtering pipeline. Players will never see components they cannot use, ensuring a clean and intuitive interface.

## Primary Racial Traits (PRTs)

Each species has exactly **ONE** Primary Racial Trait that defines their core identity and philosophy. This choice is permanent and has the most significant impact on gameplay.

### Jack of All Trades (JOAT)
**Theme:** Balanced generalists with faster, more flexible research progression

**Benefits:**
- Faster research across all tech fields
- Reduced research costs

## Technical Implementation

The racial trait system is implemented through a data-driven filtering pipeline that prevents players from seeing or using components they don't have access to.

### Core System Components

**1. Type Definitions** (`src/app/data/tech-atlas.types.ts`):
```typescript
export type PrimaryRacialTrait =
  | 'Hyper Expansion'
  | 'Super Stealth'
  | 'War Monger'
  // ... 10 total

export type LesserRacialTrait =
  | 'Improved Fuel Efficiency'
  | 'Total Terraforming'
  // ... 14 total

export interface ComponentStats {
  // ... other properties
  primaryRacialTraitRequired?: PrimaryRacialTrait[];
  primaryRacialTraitUnavailable?: PrimaryRacialTrait[];
  lesserRacialTraitRequired?: LesserRacialTrait[];
  lesserRacialTraitUnavailable?: LesserRacialTrait[];
}
```

**2. Species Model** (`src/app/models/game.model.ts`):
```typescript
export interface Species {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  habitat: { /* ... */ };
  traits: Array</* economic modifiers */>;
  primaryTraits?: PrimaryRacialTrait[];
  lesserTraits?: LesserRacialTrait[];
}
```

**3. Trait Filtering Logic** (`src/app/services/tech.service.ts` lines 129-198):
```typescript
isComponentAllowedByTraits(component: ComponentStats, player: Player): boolean {
  // 1. Check Primary Racial Trait Required (player must have ALL)
  if (component.primaryRacialTraitRequired?.length > 0) {
    const hasAllRequired = component.primaryRacialTraitRequired.every(req =>
      player.species.primaryTraits?.includes(req)
    );
    if (!hasAllRequired) return false;
  }

  // 2. Check Lesser Racial Trait Unavailable (player cannot have ANY)
  if (component.lesserRacialTraitUnavailable?.length > 0) {
    const hasAnyForbidden = component.lesserRacialTraitUnavailable.some(forbidden =>
      player.species.lesserTraits?.includes(forbidden)
    );
    if (hasAnyForbidden) return false;
  }

  // 3. Check Primary Racial Trait Unavailable (player cannot have ANY)
  if (component.primaryRacialTraitUnavailable?.length > 0) {
    const hasAnyForbidden = component.primaryRacialTraitUnavailable.some(forbidden =>
      player.species.primaryTraits?.includes(forbidden)
    );
    if (hasAnyForbidden) return false;
  }

  // 4. Check Lesser Racial Trait Required (player must have ALL)
  if (component.lesserRacialTraitRequired?.length > 0) {
    const hasAllRequired = component.lesserRacialTraitRequired.every(req =>
      player.species.lesserTraits?.includes(req)
    );
    if (!hasAllRequired) return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

### Filtering Rules

The trait checking uses the following logic:

1. **Required Traits (AND Logic):** If a component has `primaryRacialTraitRequired: ['A', 'B']`, the player must have BOTH trait A AND trait B
2. **Unavailable Traits (OR Logic):** If a component has `primaryRacialTraitUnavailable: ['A', 'B']`, the player cannot have trait A OR trait B (having either blocks the component)
3. **Evaluation Order:** Traits are checked BEFORE tech levels in the filtering pipeline
4. **Empty Arrays:** Components with no trait restrictions are available to all species (subject to tech level requirements)

### Integration Points

**Ship Designer Service** (`src/app/services/ship-designer.service.ts` lines 323-433):
- Duplicates trait filtering logic for component availability in ship designer
- Filters components before presenting them to the UI
- Ensures players never see unavailable components

**Tech Tree Display** (future):
- Will show trait requirements as icons/badges
- Gray out unavailable components with tooltip explanation
- Filter by "Available to me" vs "All components"

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite in `src/app/services/tech.service.spec.ts` with 50+ test cases covering:
- All trait requirement combinations
- All four species' component access
- Edge cases and complex trait interactions
- Integration with tech level requirements

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Species Customization:**
   - Point-buy system for creating custom species
   - Advantages cost points, disadvantages provide points
   - Validation for incompatible trait combinations

2. **UI Improvements:**
   - Trait requirement badges on component cards
   - Tooltip explaining why components are unavailable
   - Filter toggle: "Show unavailable components"
   - Trait selection screen in new game setup

3. **More Trait-Locked Components:**
   - War Monger exclusive weapons (currently has 0 components)
   - Alternate Reality unique components
   - Packet Physics mass driver weapons
   - Balance component distribution across all PRTs

4. **AI Trait Awareness:**
   - AI designs ships considering trait restrictions
   - AI exploits enemy trait weaknesses
   - AI values components it can actually use

5. **Trait-Based Events:**
   - Random events based on species traits
   - JOAT: Research breakthrough events
   - Inner Strength: Biological weapon immunity events
   - Super Stealth: Espionage opportunities

### Balance Adjustments

Monitor these areas for potential balance issues:

1. **Pyreans Dominance:** 14 exclusive components may be overpowered. Consider:
   - Increasing Bleeding Edge Technology cost penalty
   - Reducing stealth effectiveness percentages
   - Adding more counter-stealth options for other species

2. **Crystallids Weakness:** Net -2 components and no smart bombs. Consider:
   - Buffing mining bonuses (ARM, Ultimate Recycling)
   - Adding more defensive exclusive components
   - Reducing smart bomb effectiveness to make loss less impactful

3. **Unused PRTs:** War Monger, Alternate Reality, Packet Physics have no components. Plan:
   - Design unique components for each
   - Ensure each PRT has 3-5 exclusive components minimum
   - Balance new components carefully
