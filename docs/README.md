# Project Docs

- `guardrails.md` — formal engineering guardrails and conventions
- `specs/` — feature and project specifications (source of truth for implementation)
- `adr/` — architecture decision records (key decisions and trade-offs)

Start with `docs/guardrails.md` for project-wide rules, and create new feature specs under `docs/specs/`.
