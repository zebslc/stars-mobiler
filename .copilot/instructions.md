As a Copilot agent, you must adhere to the engineering guardrails and documentation provided in the `docs/` directory of this project.

Before performing any task, you must first read and understand the following files:

1.  **`docs/guardrails.md`**: This file contains the primary engineering principles, architectural guidelines, and code style rules for this project. You are required to follow these guardrails strictly.
2.  **`docs/README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the documentation structure.
3.  **`docs/adr/`**: Review the Architecture Decision Records in this directory to understand the key technical decisions and their rationale.
4.  **`docs/specs/`**: Refer to the feature and project specifications in this directory as the source of truth for implementation details.

Your primary directive is to ensure that all your contributions are consistent with the project's established standards as defined in these documents. Do not generate code or make changes that violate these guardrails.
