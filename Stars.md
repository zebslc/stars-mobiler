## INTRODUCTION

Some leaders are forged in battle. Others prefer formal training with less
bloodshed. With Stars!, your training ground is the tutorial. Use it, and you’ll
massively reduce the chances of getting your butt kicked early by the
computer or other more experienced players. The ancient races responsible
for the formation of the Stars! universe didn’t play the tutorial. Read what
happened to them.

1                WELCOME TO THE
STARS! UNIVERSE
IT’S A RELATIVELY SMALL UNIVERSE, AFTER ALL
Somewhere out on the edge of the Universe, two great races (the Sznip, a
race of crustaceans, and the Fermis, a race of nuclear plasmatoids) have
destroyed themselves and the chance for all remaining sentient races to
evolve and expand into (nearly) infinite space. Once upon a time there was a
theory that said the Universe was made up of interconnected bubbles of
space/time. The Sznip and the Fermi War proved it. The detonation that
destroyed both these super races also caused these bubbles of real space to
pop (actually a simultaneous replacement of real space with null). All the
bubbles that is, but one. This bubble of space/time, your bubble, is all that
remains. And it’s small (too small) and full (too full) of sentient species, each
on the verge of colonizing other planets and traveling between the stars. Each
race is hungry to control the little bit that’s left.

There’s bound to be trouble.

WHAT YOU’RE DOING HERE
Fortunately, the destructive element found in the terrible weapons of the
Sznips and Fermis does not exist in the Universal Remnant. So there is a limit
to the trouble you and your opponents can cause. During your first year, you’ll be ready to build your first simple space ships. Eventually you’ll build
interstellar cruisers and planet bombers, freighters the size of small moons, and weapons that will make your opponents tremble or shrug, depending on
their confidence level. You’ll colonize world after world as quickly as only
your race can. You may get lucky, and find artifacts left by those ancient races
that catalyze your research efforts, or encounter transdimensional beings
offering you knowledge that only they possess, and at low, low prices. By the
time the space dust settles, 100, 200, perhaps 500 or more years will have
passed, and either you or one of your undeserving opponents will be calling
the shots. Or, shot up, war-scarred, and with too few resources to continue, you’ll call a halt, shake hands and all settle down for a foot stomping game of
Fizbin.

1-2    IN TR O DUC TI O N

It’s the 2400th year of the Planetary Era. Your world is resource rich and
bustling with technological development. Your political leaders are giddy and, with much fanfare, have just declared this as the first year of the Galactic Era.
Your people are looking for a real leader.

## YOU ARE THE MASTER STRATEGIST

Use the Stars! control panels to command your capitol worlds and fleets, to
seek out strange new worlds and new civilizations, to boldly help your
neighbors understand their role in the doctrine of Manifest Destiny.

Stars! may seem complicated at first glance. Lots of tiles and windows, lots of
text, lots of colors. These things require a little explaining. Only a very little.

But not here. You won’t need to pay more than cursory attention to most of
the information on the screen, most of the time. It’s there when you need it.
You can even temporarily collapse some pieces if you find them distracting.

To orient yourself, before you go nose to beak with the other spacially
challenged races, PLAY THE TUTORIAL GAME. Just click on New Game in
the opening screen, then click on Tutorial in the New Game dialog.

To get help during play, LEFT-CLICK the mouse when you see this cursor:

Welcome to Universe University—a short course in creating the universe, hosting games, and operating Stars! within the confines of your computer .
Here are the administrative nuts and bolts every leader needs to know. Stay
awake. You’ll probably use only 10% of what you learn here, but you never
know which 10% it’s going to be.

## PLAYING THE TUTORIAL

Stars! contains an intelligent, online tutorial that, in the course of one short

SETTING UP NETWORK-BASED MULTI-PLAYER GAMES
In a multi-player game, designate one person as the host. This person is in
charge of generating turns and generally administering the game. A player can
also act as host.

What the Host Needs to Do (Network Play)
You will need to set up the game in a shared directory (sharepoint) accessible
to all players. This sharepoint is the place that will contain all the game files, and where the players will go to open their games. The sharepoint can exist
on a local area network, or via a modem connection (if you are using
Windows 95 Dial-up Networking capabilities—just connect to the server
machine or to another Win95 machine with the Plus Pack installed). You can
also create network connections using PC-NFS or any other software that
allows you to attach directories on the remote server as if they were local.

1. Create the sharepoint that will contain all the game files. We recommend
keeping it simple—no more than one play directory per game, for all
players in the game. You can create this directory within the directory

6. Select Auto Generate in the Host dialog. The dialog will minimize, waiting for all players to submit their turns. Stars! automatically submits
any turn into the shared directory. Once that’s done, Stars! automatically
generates a new turn, then returns to wait mode.
7. If you want to force a new turn to be generated, double-click on the Stars!
host icon, then select Generate Now from the Host dialog. To cause Stars!
to auto-generate turns again, select Auto Generate again. The dialog will
minimize and wait for players as before. Stars! will continue to follow any
existing orders for players who didn’t submit their turns on time. All
messages and data for the missed turns, such as planets discovered or
battles fought, will be present when they load the new turn.
8. Help the players understand what they need to do using the following
instructions in What Each Player Needs to Do (Network Play). If you’re
playing as well as hosting, you’ll probably find it easier to start a second
instance of Stars!, playing from one and using the other to handle host
duties.
- To quit the game, click on Close in the Host dialog.
- To restart the host, start Stars!, click on Open Game, and choose the
gamename.hst file.

What Each Player Needs to Do (Network Play)
If you’ve never played Stars! or a game like Stars! before, we recommend that
you play the tutorial before you strike out on your own. That said:
- (Optional) Before the host creates a game, use Stars! Custom Race wizard         Learn about

### Designing Custom

Races.
Once the host creates the game, do the following on the machine where
you’ll play:
1. Start Stars! and click on Open Game from the opening screen. Open your
player file, gamename.mN. This file should be located in the shared play
directory (sharepoint) set up by the host. The host is also responsible for
supplying you with the gamename.

Your game begins, with your home world displayed on the screen and in
the Command, Scanner and Selection Summary panes. For the first turn, the Message pane contains tips that help you get started. Investigate your
home planet, start basic production and research, and send your scouts
out to learn about the nearby worlds.
2. Once you finish the turn, select the menu command Turn (Wait for New ).
Stars! will minimize, waiting for a new turn.

When the new turn is ready, the Stars! icon will beep once and flash, while displaying Turn Available. If you wish, you can exit the game before
or after you finish the turn. You can save your changes or start the turn
again if you don’t like the way things are going. Read Exiting The Game

SETTING UP MODEM, FTP, AND PLAY BY E-MAIL GAMES
All multi-player games need one person to act as the host. This person is in
charge of generating turns and generally administering the game. A player can
also host a game.

What the Host Needs to Do (Modem/FTP/E-mail Play)
Stars is turn-based, not real-time. This means modems can be used to transfer          Tip: Notice the

Stars! main menu. The New Game dialog appears.                                      Races.
2. Click on Advanced Options, then specify options such as the universe

example, redstar.m1).

The order of players listed in step 2 of the New Game dialog becomes
part of the turn filename for each player.
3. Save the game using any name up to eight characters long. Stars! creates
a set of files containing data for that game and each player in the game.
You can save the game wherever you wish. By default, Stars! will save the
game files in the Stars! install directory.

3-8    GE T TI NGS TAR T ED
4. The Stars! Host dialog appears. Click on Close to stop the game until all
players have submitted their turns. If you’d like to leave Stars! running, click on Auto Generate.
5. Before the first turn each player needs to download the universe file, gamename.xy, and their player file, gamename.mN (where N is the player
number), for the newly created game. Alternately, you can upload or e-
mailgamename.xy and gamename.mN to each player. These files will be
located in the same directory in which you saved the game.
6. Help the players understand what they need to do using the instructions
in the following section on What Each Player Needs to Do
(Modem/FTP/E-mail Play). If you’re playing as well as hosting, you’ll
probably find it easier to start a second instance of Stars!, playing from
one and using the other to handle host duties.

After each player has sent you their turn (in the form of the log file, gamename.xN) do the following:
1. Place each player’s submitted log file in the directory where you set up
the game.
2. Start Stars! (if it’s not already running), click on Open Game, and open
the host file, gamename.hst.
3. If the Stars! host is set to auto-generate mode, it will automatically
generate the new turn as soon as you move the player log files into the
game directory. If you’re generating turns manually, then select Generate
Now from the Host dialog. Stars! will continue to follow any existing
orders for players who didn’t submit their turns on time. All messages and
data for the missed turns, such as planets discovered or battles fought, will be present when they load the new turn.
4. Once the turn is generated, notify the players that the new turn is
available. You can e-mail or upload each newly updated gamename.mN
file or allow each player to download it themselves.

What Each Player Needs to Do (Modem/FTP/E-mail Play)
(Optional) Before the host creates a game, use Stars! Custom Race wizard to
create a customized race, then give the race file to the host.

Once the host creates the game, do the following on the machine where
you’ll play:

MULT I- PLAY ER SET U P   3-9
1. Obtain the gamename.xy and gamename.mN files from your host, where
gamename is the name entered by the host in the File Save dialog and N
is your player number; for example, nonstop.m1.

Place these files in a playing directory you’ve created on your own
system. Use the same directory for each turn. You can create a unique
play directory for each game, or put all games into one directory.
Whatever your strategy, we recommend that you keep it simple.
2. Start Stars! and click on Open Game from the opening screen. Open your
player file, gamename.mN.

Your game begins, with your home world displayed on the screen and in
the Command, Scanner and Selection Summary panes. For the first turn, the Message pane contains tips that help you get started. Investigate your
home planet, start basic production and research, and send your scouts
out to learn about the nearby worlds.
3. Select File (Save and Submit ), then File (Exit). Or, if you’re trading turns
quickly or leave your computer on for long periods of time, you can also
use Turn (Wait for New )—a much simpler scenario.

If you wish, you can exit the game before or after you finish the turn. You
can save your changes or start the turn again if you don’t like the way
things are going. Read Exiting the Game on page 4-4 for more
information.
4. Upload or e-mail only your log file, gamename.xN file to the host system.

If you plan to be absent for more than a few turns, follow the instructions in
Being Absent from Play on page 3-10.

## SETTING AND VIEWING WINNING CONDITIONS

You can specify one or more winning conditions in step 3 of the Advanced
New Game wizard. You can also accept the default conditions provided by
Stars!. To view the winning conditions once the game has begun, choose the
View (Race) menu item, then turn to page 3 of the View Game Parameters
dialog that appears.

3-10    G ET T ING STAR T ED

Because you can control the variety and combination of winning conditions, more than one player can be declared the winner. All players are notified in a
message when someone wins. You can continue to play past this point, or end
the game.

Track the score using Reports (Score) menu item (or by pressing F10). The
Score sheet shows your score and current ranking, and a history of scores
since the game began.

## ADDING EXPANSION PLAYERS

If you think there’ll be other players joining later in the game, add an
Expansion Player for each missing person. Stars! will assign a housekeeper AI
to run things for those players until they actually join the action. This AI will
keep planets and fleets active, making sure the production queues are busy, etc. It does not develop any strategy.

MU LT I- PLAY ER SET U P   3-11

When the player joins, right click in the Host dialog on the diamond next to
their name and change the type to Human Controlled. Then, give the
latecomer a break by asking the other players to leave them alone for N years.

## BEING ABSENT FROM PLAY

When you miss a turn, Stars! will continue to follow your existing orders. All
messages and data for the missed turns, such as planets discovered or battles
fought, will be present the next time you load a turn.
Alternately, if you plan on missing more than a few turns, you can ask the
host to substitute a housekeeper AI to keep your planets and fleets active. This
AI does not develop any strategy for you.

Hot-seat and network players:
- Just tell the host you’re going inactive and ask them to substitute the AI in
your place.

Modem, e-mail or BBS players only:
1. Give your host a copy of your history file, gamename.hN. This will allow
the host to update the universe for you while you’re gone.
2. Be sure that your host returns the history file and new turn file to you
before you open your game. You won’t be able to open your turn until
this time.

What the host needs to do:
1. Open the Host dialog, if it’s not open yet. Use File (Open), selecting
gamename.hst.
2. Right-click on the blue diamond next to the name of the player who’s
absent. Choose Human (Currently inactive ).
3. When the player returns, right-click on the diamond and select Human
Controlled . You’ll have to do this before the player can open their player
file, gamename.mN.
4. If you’re running the game over a modem, e-mailor BBS, return the
updated history file, gamename.hN, and player file, gamename.mN, to
the player.

## PASSWORDS

### Create or change a password for the current game using the Commands

(Change Password) menu item.

### You can create a default game password using the following option in the

[Misc] section of stars.ini file:

DefaultPassword=<password>

<password> is the password you wish to use. If you are sure that your
opponents will not have access to your stars.ini file you can set this to your
password. Whenever you open a game file that is protected by this password
you will not be prompted to enter it. If DefaultPassword is not present in
stars.ini, type it in under the [Misc] heading.

The stars.ini file is written into your Windows directory the first time you save
a Stars! game. It doesn’t exist before that time.

Don’t Forget Your Password
If you forget or lose your password, there is nothing you can do to open the
password-protected game. We hope you’re not reading this because you’ve
forgotten. Don’t worry, empires come, empires go.

### Inactive Players and Passwords

There is no valid password for inactive players. When the player becomes
active again, they get their old password back.

USING A TIMER APPLICATION?
If you use a timer application to launch Stars! on the host system, take a look
at the variety of command line options on page 4-5. These options will do
such things as start Windows and Stars!, generate the new turn and exit both

## REPLAYING A PREVIOUS TURN

### Stars! allows you to save previous turns in case you need to resubmit a turn to

the host or replay the current turn. You can specify saving up to 999 turns
using the Backups option in the stars.ini file. If you don’t specify the number
of turns to backup, Stars! backs up only the previous turn. Once you save and
submit, Stars! saves the current turn as the most recent backup copy.

To start a turn using data from a previous turn (for example, the last turn
played):
1. Copy all files for the current game from the backup directory into the
playing directory. For example, if you originally saved the game under the
name of Nonstop, copy all files with Nonstop as the prefix. To ensure that
you are choosing the correct files, check the date/time stamp on the
backup directory.
2. Choose Open Game or File (Open). Select the player log file player turn
file (for example, nonstop.m1), and click OK. You should be back where
you started, although the universe will reflect the current positions of
other players.

SAVING YOUR GAME—WHAT IT MEANS

### Default Save Behavior

By default, saving a game saves only the current state of the current turn. The
previous turn’s data is saved in a directory called Backup, under the directory
in which you’re saving the game. Stars! creates the Backup directory

T H IN GS EVERY PLAYER SH O ULD K N OW   4-3

automatically. Each time you generate a turn, the old data in the Backup
directory is overwritten with the previous turn’s data.

### Saving the Current State of Your Game

Use the File (Save) menu item to save the current state of your game. This is
useful if you need to exit the game before you finish your turn. When you
restart Stars! just click on Continue Game to resume where you left off.

If you close the game before saving you will see this alert, you’ll be asked if
you wish to save before exiting.

### Saving More than One Previous Turn

If you’d like to save more than one previous turn for review or any other
purpose, do the following:
1. Open the stars.ini file for editing. It’s a plain text file located in your
Windows directory.
2. Under the [MISC] section, set the Backups option to a number of turns, between 1 and 999. If the Backups option isn’t present, go ahead and
type it in; for example:

Backups=50

Backup directories will be named Backup1 to BackupN. Old game files will
be stored in the backup directory according to the turn number. For example
when Backups=4 then the first turn would be backed up to the directory
backup1, the second to backup2, the third to backup3, the fourth to backup4, the fifth to backup1 and so on.

The stars.ini file is written into your Windows directory the first time you save
a Stars! game. It doesn’t exist before that time.

### Save and Submit

Multi-player Games Only
Use the File (Save and Submit ) command to save the current state of your
game and submit your turn. In multi-player games, this marks your turn as
finished so the host can auto-generate; Save does not.

4-4    GE T TI NG S TAR T ED

If you close the game before saving you’ll be asked if you wish to save and
submit your turn before exiting.

## EXITING THE GAME

Select File (Exit) or File (Close). If you’ve made changes since the beginning of
the turn, Stars! will prompt you to save or, if you’re in a multi-player game, to
save and submit your turn.

### Exiting Stars! the First Time

IMPORTANT: The first time you play Stars!, exit using the File (Exit) menu
item. This writes the stars.ini file to the Windows directory, saving game
options and helping to prevent that pesky serial number dialog from
appearing again.

### Exiting Stars! to Erase Changes

If you want to erase the changes you’ve made that turn, before you submit, do
the following:
1. Choose File (Close), without saving.
2. Select Open Game from the opening screen, then choose your player log
file from the Open File dialog. You’ll be back at the start of the turn you
just left.

Save vs. Save and Submit

### Multi-player Games Only

Use the File (Save and Submit) command to save the current state of your
game and submit your turn. In multi-player games, this marks your turn as
finished so the host can auto-generate; Save does not.

If you close the game before saving you’ll be asked if you wish to save and
submit your turn before exiting.

## OPTIONS FOR LAUNCHING STARS!

Stars! can be launched from a DOS or Windows command line, using the
Stars! command only or with a variety of options. When using an option, you
must also supply either a player or host file name as an argument. You can
also supply only the player or host file name without any other options.

With or without options, supplying the file name causes Stars! to start without
displaying the splash screen (startup bitmap).

-s – start with battle sound effects turned off

-m – start with game music turned off

-t – try, then exit. If you specify a player file, this opens the newly generated
turn. If the turn hasn’t been generated yet, then Stars! exits. If you specify a
host file, this checks to see if all players have submitted their changes for the
turn. If they have, Stars! generates the new turn and exits. Otherwise, it just
exits.

-w –wait. If you specify a host file, this auto-generates the new turn as soon as
all players have submitted their changes. If you specify a player file, this waits
for the new turn to be generated. This option does not cause Stars! to exit.

-g –generate and exit. Specify a host file only. This forces the turn to generate
regardless of whether all players have submitted changes, then exits. You can’t
load a player file when you use this option.

-p password –supplies the password on the command line. You can use this
with a host file or a password-protected player file.

-x –Exit Windows when Stars! exits. This is a good match with the -b option if       The -x flag is for

### Examples

stars! Filename              Load a player or host file, starting the game without
loading the splash screen.

stars! -w gamename.hst       Load the host file and enter Auto Generate mode.

stars! -w gamename.mN        Load the specified player file and wait for the host to
generate a new turn.

stars! -t gamename.mN        Load the specified player file; quit if the host has not yet
generated a new turn.

stars! -g gamename.hst       Load the host file, force a new turn and quit.

stars! -w -g gamename.hst Load the host file, wait for all players to submit turns, generate and quit.

stars! -t -g gamename.hst    Load the host file, generate a new turn only if all players
have submitted turns, then quit. If it generates the turn the
return value is 1; if the turn is not generated the value is 0.

stars! -t -b gamelist_file   Conditionally generate turns for a list of games.

stars! -x -b gamelist_file   Generate turns for each game listed in the supplied file
name, then exit Windows. Useful for BBS play

For example if your BBS is OS/2, NT or Windows-based you can launch Stars!
with the -b gamelist_file parameter to batch generate turns for multiple
games. Stars! will automatically exit when the last turn has been generated.

### The file listing the games must contain one game name per line including the

full path:

c:\games\stars!\play\frenzy.hst
c:\games\stars!\play\game.hst
c:\user\jeff\stars!\killer.hst

You can name this games list file anything you want. If you are running a
DOS-based BBS but have Windows installed on the machine, you can launch
Windows and Stars! from a nightly maintenance script similar to this:

win c:\games\stars!\stars!.exe -x -b c:\games\stars!\gamelist.txt

This will launch Windows and Stars!, generate a turn for each game listed in
gamelist.txt, then exit Stars! and Windows. This method is optimal for
Windows 3.1.

TH IN GS EVER Y PLAY ER SH O ULD KN O W   4-7

If you have Windows for Workgroups installed (Windows 3.11) you may want
ato use the win /n option:

win /n c:\games\stars!\stars!.exe -x -b c:\games\stars!\gamelist.txt

### This will prevent Windows from loading any of its network drivers and

suppress its login prompt. If you only need to generate a turn for a single
game you can still use the -g gamename.hst parameter with or without -x (use
-x with Windows 3.1 or 3.11only).

## COPY PROTECTION

### Save Your Serial Number

The first time you run Stars!, you will be asked to enter your unique serial
number. The number is printed on 2 labels enclosed in the pack.

### It is very important that you keep the serial number where you can find it

later .

Stars! may ask for the number again if :
- You re-install Stars!
- You change your computer ’s configuration.
- You install a Stars! upgrade.

### One Computer - One Serial Number

Each computer running Stars! must use a unique serial number. Given this, the copy protection activates ONLY in the following situations:
- When you cancel the serial number dialog .
- When players using the same serial number submit turns created on two
different computers . This includes submitting turns from networked
computers sharing a serial number. If you want to submit turns from
different machines on a network, each of those machines must have a
copy of Stars! installed with a unique serial number.
- One person submits turns for two or more player positions from
different computers that share the same Stars! serial number .

4-8    GE T TI NG S TAR T ED

In every case, Stars! will give you a chance to enter a unique serial number
and continue play normally.

### How the Copy Protection Works

Stars! is played by submitting player log files to the host (either a human or
the game itself). Each log file is tagged with the serial number for the copy of
Stars! used to generate the file, and a fingerprint of the computer on which
the game was installed. If the Stars! host receives two or more log files with
different computer fingerprints and the same serial number it assumes that all
the players associated with those log files are guilty of software piracy, and
activates the copy protection for those players (honest players are unaffected).
The copy protection makes the game unplayable for the guilty parties, until
each player enters a unique serial number. As soon as each player submits
turns with a unique serial number, the copy protection deactivates.

The Host Doesn’t Need a Serial Number

### A host can use the same serial number as one other player without affecting

the host or the player. This allows you to host and play from the same copy of

### Stars!

Computers Running More than One Version of Windows
If you are running some combination of Windows 95, NT or 3.x on a single
computer you will be asked for a serial number the first time you run Stars!
under each version of Windows. After that, you should only be bothered for
the number if you change your system configuration or delete the stars.ini file
from the Windows directory. Each version of Windows will have its own
directory containing Windows system software. By default, this directory is
named Windows. You may have named it something different on your system.

THE STARS! SCREEN
You can’t manage an empire with a stick and whistle.

using the Waypoints Task tile. Assigning repeat orders works
best when the first waypoint in the list is repeated as the last.

### Waypoint Task tile

This tile shows the task the fleet must perform at that waypoint
selected in the Fleet Waypoints tile. Click on the dropdown to
assign a task.

THE STARS! SCREEN 5-7

### Transport tasks

Use this task to load or unload minerals, fuel or colonists.
The middle dropdown lists methods of loading and unloading.
When you assign a load/unload action, the cargo name turns
from black to green. Some load/unload actions allow you to
specify exact amounts.

Zip Orders: To quickly load fuel, minerals and colonists, right-click on the blue diamond and choose a
pre-defined order from the list. If a Zip Order doesn’t quite meet your needs, you can create your own or
modify the existing order.
Load / Unload Actions:
(no action)              No transport task for the specified cargo.

Load All Available       Load as much of the specified cargo as the fleet can hold.

Unload All               Unload all the specified cargo at the waypoint.
Load Exactly...          Load the amount specified only if there is room in the hold.
Unload Exactly...        Unload the amount specified only if the fleet is carrying that amount.
Fill up to %...          Loads up to the specified portion of the cargo hold subject to amount available at
waypoint and room left in hold.
Wait for %...            Remain at the waypoint until exactly X % of the hold is filled.
Load Optimal             (fuel only) Load or unload fuel until the fleet carries only the exact amount needed to
reach the next waypoint. You can use this task to send a fleet loaded with fuel to
rescue a stranded fleet. The rescue fleet will transfer only the amount of fuel it can
spare without stranding itself.
Load Dunnage             (minerals and colonists only) This command waits until all other loads and unloads are
complete, then loads as many colonists or amount of a mineral as will fit in the
remaining space. For example, setting Load All Germanium, Load Dunnage Ironium, will load all the Germanium that is available, then as much Ironium as possible. If
more than one dunnage cargo is specified, they are loaded in the order of Ironium, Boranium, Germanium, and Colonists.

Set Amount to...         Load or unload the cargo until the amount on board is the amount specified. If less
than the specified cargo is available, the fleet will not move on.

Set Waypoint to...       Load or unload the cargo until the amount at the waypoint is the amount specified.
This order is always carried out to the best of the fleet’s ability that turn but does not
prevent the fleet from moving on.

### Colonize

Use this task to transport colonists to an unpopulated planet.
The fleet must contain a ship with a colonization module, and
must be loaded with colonists. Once the colony is established
you can use freighters to transport additional colonists.

### Remote Mining

Use this task to mine an uninhabited planet. The fleet must
have robot miners. The quantity of each mineral the fleet can
mine annually is shown by tonnage and color.
Blue: Ironiumm
Green: Boraniumm
Yellow: Germanium

### Merge with Fleet

Use this task to merge the fleet under command with a fleet at
the waypoint. The fleet given this task will be assimilated into
the target fleet and assume its orders.
To pick from multiple fleets at the waypoint, right-click on the
blue diamond in the Fleet Waypoints tile. Otherwise, Stars!
will pick the most dormant fleet with similar ships.

### Scrap Fleet

Use this task to salvage a portion of the minerals in the hulls
of outdated or unrecoverable ships. Players can also trade
technological knowledge by scrapping ships at each other’s
planets.

### The minerals are deposited on the planet where the fleet is

scrapped. The percentage of minerals recovered varies
depending on the situation.

THE STARS! SCREEN 5-9

### Lay Mine Fields

Use this task to lay mines at the waypoint. Fleets given this
task must have mine layers. The tile notes how many mines
the fleet will lay for each year it performs the task.

### Patrol

Use this task to intercept incoming enemy fleets. Set the
detection range to specify how far away the patrol ship will
look for interlopers. Manually select an intercept speed, or use
the default of Automatic intercept in the shortest possible time
using the least amount of fuel.

### Route

Use the Route task to automatically send fleets from one
planet to another. If the waypoint planet has a routing
destination, the fleet assigned this task will automatically set
that destination as its next waypoint.
Route destinations are set using the Production tile.

### Transfer Fleet

Use this task to place one of your fleets under the command
of another player, and to give that player knowledge of the
design of all ships in that fleet.

### This task will fail if the receiving player does not have enough

free ship design slots.

### Bringing a Fleet or Planet into the Command pane

Stars! provides more than one way to command a planet or fleet. Use the method that suits your
needs.

To command the planet you are orbiting, click on Goto in the
Location tile. (The planet must already belong to you.)

From the Command pane, you can select one of your fleets in
the same location using the Fleets in Orbit tile. Just choose a
fleet from the dropdown list and click on Goto.

You can also use the Scanner pane to bring either a planet or fleet into the Command pane. If the
object you wish to command is the only thing at that location, just double-click on it in the
Scanner.
When more than one object is in the same location, do one of the following:
- Right-click on the location, then click on the name of the object from the pop-up list.
- Left-click on the location till the object you wish to command appears in the Command pane.
When clicking on a location to cycle through your planet and fleets, other player’s fleets are
skipped. Even though you’d like to, you can’t display these fleets in the Command pane. Other
player’s fleets, if present, are listed in the pop-up: selecting one will display what you know about
that fleet in the Selection Summary pane.

There are six exclusive scanner views, which you can use with one or more overlays. Use the
toolbar above the scanner to select views and overlays. Display or hide the toolbar with the View
(Toolbar) menu item.

### Normal view

This default scanner view displays the essentials, such as planets, fleets
positions, orbital devices, salvage sites, wormholes.

THE STARS! SCREEN 5-13

### Surface Minerals

This view displays the quantity of minerals under the surface at each
planet you own or have scanned. The mineral colors and scale
matches the display in the Summary pane’s mineral content graph.
Rescaling that graph rescales the bars in this view.

### Mineral Concentration

This view displays the concentration of minerals under the surface at
each planet you own or have scanned. The mineral colors and scale
matches the display in the Summary pane’s mineral content graph.
Rescaling that graph rescales the bars in this view.

### Planet Value

This view uses color and size to display which planets are best suited
to your race. Blue flags mark your planets, yellow flags mark your
friends’ planets and red flags mark planets of neutrals and enemies.
Planets without flags are uninhabited.
Green: habitable. The larger the circle, the more hospitable the
planet.
Yellow: habitable after terraforming. Larger circles indicate faster
minimal terraforming and better results.
Red:    uninhabitable. The larger the circle, the harsher the planet.

### Population

This view displays population levels. The wider the circle, the larger
the population. Planets are sorted by color:
Green: your colonized planets
Yellow: friends
Red:    enemies and neutrals
Uncolonized planets that you’ve visited are small and grey.

### No Player Information

This view hides all traces of planet ownership. Just a thousand dim points of light.

### Add Waypoints Mode

You can add waypoints for the fleet under command using just the mouse. This mode is primarily
for beginning players, or anyone who wants to eat and play at the same time.

### Scanner Coverage overlay

This overlay displays the effectiveness of radar coverage at the
percentage selected in the dropdown. Reducing the displayed
coverage does not change the actual coverage—it only gives you an
idea of what your coverage would be in relation to the cloaking ability
of opponents’ ships. For example, select 75% to show how close a
fleet with 25% cloaking will need to be before you can detect it.

### Mine Fields overlay

This overlay displays minefields as colored grids. Your minefields are
blue, friends are yellow, and enemies and neutrals are red.
You can see both the center and radius of another player’s minefield
only if either the center of the mine field is in range of your
penetrating scanner, or you have hit the minefield at least once and
the center is in range of your normal scanners or you are currently in
the minefield.

### Fleet Paths overlay

This overlay displays the assigned paths of all your fleets.

THE STARS! SCREEN 5-15

### Planet Names overlay

This overlay displays planet names in the scanner. If the names are too
crowded, increase the scanner zoom factor to place more distance
between planets. If Player Colors is activated, planet names appear in
the color assigned to that player. Your planet names always appear in
white.

### Ship Count overlay

This overlay displays the number of ships at a location. Active Ship

### Design and Enemy Ship Class filters will limit the count to ships

specified in those filters. For example, if you have a filter that displays
only enemy warships, the number above enemy fleets and planets will
be the count of only warships.
If Player Colors are turned on, numbers appear in the color assigned
to that player. Your fleet numbers always appear in white.

### Idle Fleets filter

Idle fleets are fleets with no movement orders. This overlay displays only your idle fleets and any
active enemy fleets. Only those planets with idle fleets in orbit will show orbit rings. Fleets that
have run out of fuel are still considered active, and won’t appear if you’re using only this overlay.
Exception: Claim Adjuster fleets that are terraforming from orbit are not considered idle.

### Ship Design filter

This overlay displays only those fleets that contain a specific ship design. Only those planets
orbited by the selected ships will have orbit rings.

### Enemy Ship Class filter

This overlay displays opponent fleets containing a specific selected ship class. Opponents’fleets
appears as red triangles. Only opponents’ planets orbited by the selected ships will have orbit
rings.

## PLAYING STARS!

The essence of Stars! is resource management. To win, learn what it takes to
smoothly and effectively grow and manage your empire’s industrial
infrastructure. Learn when to colonize, when to move people and other
resources so that your empire becomes stronger and more balanced with
each passing year. Learn how to make resource management more expensive
for your opponents than it is for you. When you attack, look for targets
where the cost to your opponent is greater than your investment in the
offense. (This is especially true in a solo game.)

6               PLANETS

Planets are the gold nuggets of the Stars! universe: everybody
wants them, and hardly anyone wants to share. ‘Green’worlds
give your people a place to grow, learn and produce. The
minerals in each planet provide the building blocks for all the
technology you create, including planetary installations such as
defenses and scanners, and starbases with stargates that act as navigational
shortcuts and mass drivers that fling minerals between systems.

When you click on a planet in the Scanner, you’re actually selecting a star
system. The planet that appears on your screen is the most desirable planet in
that system. (There may be lesser rocks in the system, too, but you won’t want
them.) If you colonize a planet, it becomes your capitol world in that system, the local center of government and industry. If the planet is dangerous to your
people, you can mine it from orbit, and ship its valuable minerals to other
parts of your empire. If the planet is inhabited by another player, you can try
to take it away. If the owner is another human, you can also try to establish
trade relations.

No matter how you play, you need to give your people room to grow. That
growth rate will vary on any given planet, depending on the levels of gravity, temperature, and radiation. You can create a race that is immune to one or
more of these environmental factors—a very expensive advantage. You can
also make a planet’s environment more hospitable by terraforming.

## YOUR HOME WORLD AND OTHER INHABITED PLANETS

You start the game on your home world, a place with optimal environmental
conditions where you have a small but thriving population, basic industry in
the form of factories and mines, fundamental technology, and a short range, planet-based scanner. In orbit, you have a starbase capable of building ships
and providing a small amount of planetary defense. Each player’s home

## MINERALS

All planets contain three important raw minerals: ironium, boranium and
germanium. These provide the building blocks for almost everything your race
produces. Minerals exist both on and under the planet’s surface. Minerals
found on the surface can be used immediately in production. Those under the
surface must be mined to become available for use. Minerals can be

A planet can have only one starbase at a time. An existing starbase can be
upgraded or replaced, with credit given for the recycled materials.

You’ll have access to additional starbase hulls if you have the Improved

### Starbase Design

There are five starbase hulls, with slots for weapons, armor and other items:

Orbital Fort — No ship building or refueling capacity. These don’t count as
starbases in the score.

Space Dock — Ship building capacity: 200kT or smaller ships. This hull

### Upgrading a Starbase

You can upgrade a starbase by changing the hull or by adding or changing
items in the hull slots. You receive full credit for the existing installation, paying only the difference between the old and new hulls. The upgrade
appears in the production inventory, ready for you to add to the production
queue when you wish.

Here’s how the cost is determined:

If the hull changes:
- You receive a 50% credit for minerals and resources used in the original
starbase.

If the hull does not change:
- Slots where the components don’t change are free.
- Slots where only the count of the component increases cost only the
component price multiplied by the number of additional items.
- Slots where the component type changes to a similar component are
discounted in cost; the discount based on the closeness of the part types.
- Slots where the component type changes dramatically cost the full price
of the new component. You will receive some minerals back if the old
components are recycled.

## MASS DRIVER BASICS

### Mass drivers provide a fuel-free method of transporting mineral

cargo packets between planets, and, secondarily, can act as an
effective long range weapon. Mineral packets are bundles of
ironium, germanium and boranium. Mass drivers fling mineral
packets at high rates of acceleration. This prevents you from flinging Fuel, which would explode, or colonists, who would, well, also explode.

In the Scanner pane, a mass driver appears as a purple dot orbiting the planet.

### Building a Mass Driver

A mass driver occupies the Orbital slot in a starbase hull. You’ll have to
research Energy—the requirement for each type of driver is listed in the
Orbital section of the Technology Browser.

Once you complete your research, upgrade your starbase hull design to hold
the driver (or design a new starbase hull that includes the driver). To upgrade
a hull and add the driver:
1. Choose the Commands (Ship Design...) menu item, opening the Ship and

PLAN ETS          6-13

### You may fling packets at speeds up to three Warp levels above the rated

speed. Packets flung above the rated speed become unstable, decaying at
10% per year for one warp level above the rated speed, 20% for two warp
levels, and 50% for three warp levels. Packets decay in the year they are
launched and in the year they arrive at a planet proportional to the distance
they travel in those years.

During a packet’s first year out, it travels only half the normal distance, then
the normal distance in any following years of travel. Since production
happens all year long, the packets could be launched at any point. Stars!
simplifies this by averaging it out to a half-year’s travel.

You can’t attack mineral packets. You can only intercept them and transfer

appears to transfer minerals from the packet to your fleet.

### Building Two Mass Drivers on a Starbase

You can build up to two identical mass drivers on the same starbase
(assuming you haven’t used an Orbital slot with a stargate already). This has
two advantages: 1) you can catch incoming packets at one warp speed greater

Terraforming is the ability to change a planet’s environment to make it more
habitable for your race. If you are immune to environmental conditions, you
don’t need to terraform.

Click on a planet in the Scanner pane, then look in the Selection Summary
pane. The habitability value shows the current value of the planet followed in
parentheses by the value the planet would be after terraforming (given the
limits of your current technology).

The environment graph shows how much you can modify the planet’s
environment, given your level of terraforming technology. The following
graph shows that the player possesses Gravity and Radiation terraforming
technology, and that Radiation must be terraformed to make the planet
habitable. Gravity is currently well within this race’s habitable range, and may
be terraformed to the optimum level.

PLAN ETS   6-15

### Habitable range

the exact range

Original     Current value        Best value possible applying

You don’t have to worry about the order in which the different factors are
terraformed. The terraforming task that appears in the production dialog
always works on the factor that is the furthest out of range. If you can improve
Gravity by 3%, Temperature by 5% and Radiation by 2% the Production
dialog will let you add 10% Terraforming to the queue. Each 1% Terraforming
task executed will modify one of the environmental factors by 1%, which will
improve the overall habitability value by at least 1% and probably more.

Find out which factor should be terraformed to maximize the planet’s
habitability value by clicking in the environment graph of the Summary pane.

### A pop-up will tell you the potential increase in habitability value if you

modify that factor to the limits of your current level of technology.

There are two basic ways to terraform a planet. The first and easiest is to add
auto-build terraforming tasks to the production queue. Min and Max

### Terraforming are auto-build tasks which remain in the queue and operate only

when both necessary and possible. These can be added manually or using a
production template. The second method is to manually add the Terraform
Environment task to the production queue.

6-16    P LAYI NG ST AR S !

Terraforming tasks can use only the terraforming technology you possess. So, if you have only Radiation and Temperature Terraforming, you can modify
only radiation and temperature levels, but not gravity. The terraforming will
automatically act first on the environmental attribute which when modified
will most improve the planet’s habitability.

### Colonists Die if Minimum Terraforming Lasts More than One Year

If it takes longer than one year after colonizing to bring the planet to a           Claim Adjusters
habitability value of 0% or better, your colonists will start to die. If you can     Claim Adjusters

Terraforming added manually must wait until the following year.

### Terraforming with Auto-build Tasks

1. Bring the planet you wish to terraform under command.
2. Click on Change in the Production tile. The Production dialog opens.
3. In the production inventory, click on either the Min Terraform or Max
Terraform auto-build tasks. Then click on Add to raise the limit to which
the task will terraform.

Minimal (Min) terraforming changes only those environmental factors that
have a negative value and that you have the technology to change, up to the
percentage you specify in the task. Terraforming will continue only until the
habitability value reaches zero. To go beyond the point of minimal
terraforming, you must manually add Terraform Environment or the Max
Terraforming auto-build task. Minimal Terraforming will activate and terraform
only when there are resources available and not doing so would cause people
to die on the planet (from negative environment values or overcrowding).

PLAN ET S        6-17

### Max Terraforming changes any environmental attributes that you have the

technology to change, up to the percentage you specify in the task.

As each terraforming task completes, an environmental factor is improved by
1%.

### Terraforming as a Default Action

Command pane.
2. Click on Change in the Production tile.
3. In the production inventory, click on the Terraform Environment task.
Then click on Add to add the desired number of this task to perform.

### Each Terraform Environment task you add to the production queue improves

an environment factor by 1%. The number of tasks you may add to the queue
is limited by the current level of your terraforming technology. When you
have successfully completed all the tasks you can add to the queue, the
Terraform Environment task disappears from the production inventory. It will
reappear once you achieve a higher level of technology that allows you to
terraform further.

### Types of Terraforming Technology

Each of a planet’s three environmental factors has a matching type of
terraforming technology: Temperature Terraforming, Gravity Terraforming, and
Radiation Terraforming. Each requires a different combination of research:
- Temperature terraforming requires research into Biotechnology and                  The Total
Energy.                                                                            Terraforming trait
requires that you

### Biotechnology to
- Radiation terraforming requires research into Biotechnology and                    learn terraforming
technology
Weapons.

Each technology allows you to improve a specific factor a minimum of 3%
from its initial value and a maximum (without Total Terraforming) of 15%.

### The percentage of improvement does not always indicate how much the

value of the planet will increase. Often only one or two environmental factors
will be negative, while the remaining factors look pretty attractive. In this case
improving the negative factors can improve the planet’s overall value to a
much higher percentage than that indicated by the technology.

As you upgrade your terraforming technology, you’ll see the amount you can
improve the planet increase. You may also see that some planets that were
previously not terraformable (red in Planet Value view) become terraformable
(yellow in Planet Value view).

### To learn more about the individual types of terraforming technology and their

research requirements, open the Technology Browser (Press F2) and select
Terraforming from the dropdown list.

### Total Terraforming

Total Terraforming is a race trait, not a type of technology. Races
with Total Terraforming begin the game with the ability to
improve temperature, gravity and radiation levels up to 3%.
Terraforming requires 30% less resources and you can research

as soon as the planet is deserted or taken over, the environmental conditions

### As the race learns more about terraforming all its planets are automatically

Claim Adjusters and Terraforming Other Players’ Planets from Orbit
Races based on the Claim Adjuster trait can terraform other player’s planets
from orbit. This creates unique opportunities for diplomacy or war. If the
owner is your Friend, you automatically perform positive terraforming
(adjusting planetary conditions toward the inhabitants’ optimal conditions). If
the owner is your Enemy, you perform negative terraforming.

Terraforming from orbit requires a fleet outfitted with Orbital Adjusters. These
are described in the Mining Robots section of the Technology Browser. Every
race with the Claim Adjuster trait starts out with one ship outfitted with
Orbital Adjusters.

### Orbital Adjuster

Terraforming from orbit is a great vehicle for diplomacy: in return for other

terraformed to the limits of whoever possesses the superior technology. For
example, if the inhabitants have 3% terraforming and you possess 5%
terraforming, the planet can be improved up to 5% from its original
conditions (not exceeding optimal conditions for the inhabitants).

Terraforming from orbit can also be used as a weapon: just orbit the planet
and start to terraform it under your opponent’s feet. This allows you to prepare
more favorable conditions for a planetary invasion. You must destroy any
existing starbase before you can launch this type of attack. Depending on

When a planet can only use one of an item, such as a planet-based scanner

item is added to the queue, it disappears from the inventory.

### Upgrades of Existing Items

Upgrades of existing items, such as stargates and starbase hulls, will replace
any older versions in the inventory list. When you upgrade a item, it is
labeled in the inventory as an upgrade. Since upgrades enhance rather than
replace an item, they only require enough minerals to create the
enhancements.

### Production Template Strategy

To help illustrate how production templates are useful, here’s an example of a
useful default template for new colonies:

Minimum Terraform Up to 10%
Factories (Auto Build) Up to 10
Mines (Auto Build) Up to 10
Defenses (Auto Build) Up to 2
Factories (Auto Build) Up to 25
Mines (Auto Build) Up to 25
Maximum Terraform Up to 10%
Defenses (Auto Build) Up to 5

Minimum Terraform Up to 10%

### The planet will work on terraforming first if it is possible and people might die

otherwise. This handles fledgling negative worlds, overcrowding and disasters.

Factories (AB) Up to 10 / Mines (AB) Up to 10

PR ODU CT ION       7-5

You want constant progress on improving the planet’s productivity. This is
what fledgling colonies spend most of their time doing.

Defenses (AB) Up to 2

### If the planet is doing well enough to complete all those mines and factories

you can afford to work on defenses a bit to keep from falling way behind.
Fledgling colonies don’t make it this far.

Factories (AB) Up to 25 / Mines (AB) Up to 25

### At this point we want to ensure the planet has the maximum number of mines

and factories. Only mature planets will reach this point.

Maximum Terraform Up to 10%
Push a mature planet to perfection. The mines and factories are probably
maximized for the current population so, if possible, increase the maximum
population and growth rate.

Defenses (AB) Up to 5

### Add defenses if the colony has the maximum number of mines and factories

possible for the current population.

### Contribute only Leftover Resources

While the colony is fledgling it is a good idea to have “Contribute only
leftover resources to research” checked. When the colony reaches the point
were the defenses are being auto-built you can deselect the “Contribute only
…” option.

### Creating a Template

1. Make sure the auto-build items in the queue are arranged in the same
order in which they should appear in the template.                              Auto-build items do
not need to be

## UNBLOCKING A PRODUCTION QUEUE

7-8    PLAYI NG STARS !

If your planet’s mineral concentration runs so low that the time to completion
exceeds 100 years, the item name turns red. This means it will practically
never be completed unless you do something about it. You have two choices:
transport minerals from other planets or use mineral alchemy (or use a
combination of the two).

### Transporting Minerals

To transport minerals, set up freighter waypoints to transport minerals from
your remote miners or mineral-rich planets to your planet with the blocked
production queue. If you have a mass driver on the needy planet and the
mineral-rich planet, you can also fling mineral packets between planets
without using ships.

### Mineral Alchemy

Mineral alchemy transmutes resources into minerals (sort of your own
Philosopher’s Stone). If you can’t complete an item in the queue because
you’ve run low on one or more minerals, place mineral alchemy in the queue
ahead of the item you’re trying to build. Each unit of mineral alchemy will
turn a mere 100 of your resources (25 if you have the Mineral Alchemy trait)
into 1 kT of each of the three minerals. This is a good strategy for unblocking
queues on a planet where you have a large population and can quickly
replace the resources used by alchemy.

### Add as many mineral alchemy units as you need to finish the item stuck in

the queue. Like other items in a queue, the color of each Mineral Alchemy
task will tell you how long it will take for the process to complete. If you have
a large number of resources dedicated to production, you can create a large
amount of minerals fairly quickly.

Mineral alchemy is one of the items available for auto-building. Consider
adding it to your default or a custom production template, if it isn’t already
there. If auto-alchemy is placed in front of an item, it will be used only if you
have a mineral shortage. If it is the only item in the queue, it will convert
resources into minerals until you remove it or place another item immediately
following.

PR O DU C TI O N   7-9

ADDING AUTO-BUILD ITEMS TO THE QUEUE
Auto-build items are always in italic, but appear differently in the production
inventory and queue.

When they’re in the inventory, they are labeled as Auto-build. When you add
them to the queue, they are labeled <Item> up to <number>; for example, Factories Up to 50. The latter number indicates that the queue will attempt to
produce the stated number of that item every year.

Auto-build Mineral Alchemy is the exception, displaying as Mineral Alchemy
as needed. If you insert it in front of an item in the queue you want to perform
as much Alchemy as possible to maximize the production rate for that item. If
you already have enough minerals, Mineral Alchemy isn’t needed and doesn’t
happen. It’s a great insurance policy that always does the right thing. If
Alchemy is the last item in the queue, it means to spend all remaining
resources on Mineral Alchemy.

### Auto-build items can be used to create a default queue for newly colonized

worlds, or for items you wish to produce on any world whenever extra
resources are available for production, or when the queue is empty of
anything but auto build items. For example, early in the game, it’s useful to
continuously build mines and factories. It’s always useful to auto-terraform
when conditions are less than perfect and you have the means.

Like any production item, auto build items can be inserted anywhere in the
queue. An auto build item stays in the queue until you remove it. This means
your production queue will annually attempt to build these items when
possible. You can always place other items ahead of auto-build items, or
rearrange the items in the queue. Auto build items that cannot be built are
skipped.

7-10    PLAYI NG ST ARS !

There are, however, differences between the behavior of auto-build items and
others in the queue:
- Auto-build items do not block the queue. If they cannot be performed, they are skipped over.
- Auto-build items are never automatically removed from the queue. They
remain there until manually removed and activate only when necessary
and possible.
- You never make progress on auto-build items. When work is done it is
seen as a partially completed normal build item in the queue.

Auto-build items include Mines, Factories, Defenses, Mineral Alchemy, Terraforming, and auto-building and flinging Mineral Packets (if you have a
mass driver).

## CHANGING THE ORDER OF PLANETS IN THE PRODUCTION

### DIALOG

You can use the Planet report to change the order in which planets appear in
the production dialog. This allows you to easily find the planets that may
need upgrades of a specific type (such as starbases) and add the upgrades to
the production queue.
1. Press F3 to open the Planet report.
2. Click at the head of any column, choosing a sort that appeals to you. You
may want to sort by starbase, by production, mines, factories—anything
you wish.

## CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT PRODUCTION

Page 5 of the View Race dialog tells you if you excel at building and
operating factories and mines, as well as how many resources N colonists will
generate each year (not counting the resources created by factories). The more
each of the following conditions are true, the more your race will excel at
production:
- One resource is generated each year for every seven colonists.
- Factories produce 15 resources per year.
- Every factory requires five resources (and the usual amount of minerals) to
build.
- Colonists may operate 25 factories.
- Factories cost one mineral less to build.

Of course, the mining rate also affects production. The closer your race is to
meeting one or more of the following conditions, the better:
- Mines produce 25 kT of minerals per year.
- Every mine requires two resources to build.
- Every 10,000 colonists can operate 25 mines.

### How Research Makes Production Cheaper

Production of a particular item becomes cheaper when all research
requirements are surpassed by one level. For example, an engine requiring
research level 3 Propulsion and level 1 Energy becomes 4% cheaper when             Learn more about
you attain level 4 Propulsion and level 2 Energy, 16% cheaper with level 7         Factories, p 6-5
Propulsion, level 5 Energy, and so on. You can eventually reduce the cost of       Mining, p 13-1
producing some items by 75% (or 80%, if you possess the Bleeding Edge trait,       Research, p 8-1
which decreases costs at a rate of 5% per level instead of the normal 4%).

### Disaster Strikes Planet X!

When comets or other naturally occurring blunt instruments crash into
inhabited planets, the planet’s production queue is reset. All work in progress
is lost, including the resources spent on that work. It’s not all bad. Usually a
cosmic barrage brings extra minerals that you can apply immediately to
production.

8               RESEARCH

You can’t go from rubber band drives to ramscoops or from binoculars to
520X planetary scanners without applying mental elbow grease. This means
research. Fortunately, to conduct research in Stars!, you need to know nothing
of physics or animal husbandry, biomechanics or elastic waistbands. You only
need to know which general areas of technology you wish to research and
how many resources you wish to allocate to that research. That, pushing a        Resources are units

do that.

## FIELDS OF STUDY

There are six fields of study: Energy, Weapons, Propulsion, Construction,
Electronics, and Biotechnology. You
can research only one at a time. The
levels of proficiency range from 0 to
26 (at 26, you are a techno-geek
summa cum astrolabe, a level that
20th century hi-tech moguls can only
daydream about reaching). When you
complete a research level, new
technology becomes available to you.

Going beyond the level needed to produce an item has cost benefits: for
every technology level you achieve above the required level, the production

8-2    PLAYI NG ST ARS !

cost of that item is reduced by 5%. You can eventually reduce the production
costs for many items by 75%. This is also referred to as miniaturization.

### The type of research needed to gain a technology depends on the function of

that technology. For example, most ship hulls require Construction research
only. Some technology requires research into more than one area: Gravity
Terraforming requires research in both Biotechnology and Propulsion.

### Use the Research dialog to specify a field of study and the percentage of

resources you wish to apply annually to that research. The dialog also
displays the specific technology you’ll gain by achieving the next few levels
in that field. Resources applied to research are taken off the top of your
resource heap. This allocation is modified only if you check Contribute Only
Leftover Resources to Research in the Production dialog, reversing the order
and allocating resources first to production, then research.

You can change research fields before achieving a new level. Stars! keeps
track of how much progress you’ve made in a field, allowing you to return to
a partially researched field at any time without losing progress.

### Choosing the Next Field of Study

Queue your next field of interest using the Next Field to Research dropdown
in the Research dialog. This switches your research as soon as you reach the
next level in your current field. All resources not needed to reach the next
level in your current field are applied to the next field.

If you achieve the maximum level for a field and forget to specify a new field, Stars! automatically selects the least researched field.

## ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH

### How Production Affects Research

For research, you receive all resources from planets with nothing in the
production queue and with auto-build turned off. You also receive all unspent
resources from planets with queues blocked by lack of minerals. If the

### Contribute Only Leftover Resources to Research box is selected in the

Production dialog, you’ll only receive the resources left over if the planet’s
queue is emptied that turn.

If this box is not selected, you’ll receive the percentage of resources you
indicated in the Research dialog, plus any resources left if the production
queue if emptied that turn. If the production queue is blocked you’ll receive
all the resources from that planet for that turn.

### Predicting How Much Time Research will Take

Predicting the amount of time it will take to complete a research level is
slightly tricky. Stars! displays the Estimated Time to Completion in the
Research dialog.

The estimate is based on an unchanging supply of resources, including the
following:
- all resources from planets with empty production queues and non-active
auto-build
- allocated resources from planet’s items in production but who are
dedicating resources to production first (Contribute Only Leftover
Resources to Research box is not selected).

R ESEAR CH         8-5

To get your best estimate of how long research will take, look at both the
current time estimate and the number of resources allocated the previous year
(also shown in the Research dialog). Each turn, check how much the estimate
changes as a result of changing conditions in your empire.

To get a more accurate estimate, assign or change your research allocation as
the last task of your turn. By then, Stars! will know how many resources are
required for production and will remove those from the calculation for
research time.

### Sample Strategies for Resource Allocation

Some people play Stars! with global research allocation set to a low number, assuming that on some turns production queues will run out of things to do
and large amounts of resources will be allocated automatically to research.
Other people like to keep their production queues busy all the time, and need
to allocate a larger research allocation up front. Both styles can be equally
successful.

## THE COST OF RESEARCH

Research becomes more expensive for each level of technology you achieve.
You spend resources to do research. Research in any field becomes
progressively more expensive, increasing in a Fibonacci type series. The total        Fibonacci numbers

Then you’ll never use more resources than necessary to learn a technology.
Ultimately, though, it costs the same to research all technology. The added

9               SHIP AND STARBASE DESIGN

Use the Ship and Starbase Designer to create, edit and delete new ship and
starbase designs. Once you create a new ship design you can add it to the
production queue of any of your planets that has a starbase with a space
dock.

You don’t need a starbase to build a starbase. If your colony has the resources
and minerals, just add the starbase to the queue.

## DELETING AN EXISTING HULL DESIGN

If you delete an existing design, all ships that use that design are destroyed, and their minerals are lost to the cosmos. If you wish to retrieve some of the
minerals used in the ship, scrap all the ships using that design, then delete the
design.

A plaque appears below ship schematics of existing designs. It tells you how
many ships built on the selected design still exist. If you delete an existing
design, any existing ships built with that design will be destroyed.

In this case, all 19 ships built on this design have already been
destroyed. Deleting this design will not destroy any existing ships.

In this case, 34 out of the 36 ships built on this design remain
intact. Deleting this design will destroy all 34 remaining ships.
Ships destroyed by this mechanism are not recycled for scrap.

### Deleting Designs Using the Ship and Starbase Designer

1. In the Ship and Starbase Designer, select Existing Designs.
2. Click on the dropdown list and select the design to delete.
3. Click on Delete Existing Design .

### Other Methods of Deleting Hull Designs

Pick a design that is no longer useful (too slow, ineffective weapons). Before
you delete the design, think of the most advantageous way to get rid any
existing ships of that design. The following provide example strategies:

Example 1: Send each ship of the design to planets that need minerals. Set the
waypoint task at each planet to Scrap Fleet . A portion of the minerals will be
returned to the surface supply on that planet. If you use this method, you’ll
have to wait until all the affected ships reach their assigned waypoints.

Example 2: Delete all the ships at in one stroke using the Ship and Starbase
Designer. You’ll be warned that all the ships of that design will be destroyed.
When you delete ships this way you receive NO minerals.

Example 3: If the ships of the type you wish to delete use any weapons, use
them in a large battle as distracting cannon fodder, possibly keeping your
more advanced ships safer a little longer.

10               MANAGING FLEETS

A fleet is a distinct group of one or more ships, and can be any mix of ship
types. Fleets can be created, merged, and split at any point in the game. You
design the ship types, add them to production queues, create fleets, then
assign waypoints and tasks. Fleets can be used for exploration, defense and
offense, colonizing, remote mining, and transporting minerals and people.

## ASSEMBLING FLEETS

Each player can have up to 32,000 ships of each design in a fleet, with up to
16 different designs, and up to 512 fleets.

For some tasks a fleet with a single ship is sufficient. For example, exploration
or colonization usually only requires one ship outfitted with the appropriate
technology. However, for moving large quantities of minerals around, for
defending your planets and for attacking other players it’s very useful to have
large groups of ships in a single fleet.

You can merge and split fleets as you wish, using the Merge Fleets waypoint
task or the Merge and Split buttons in the Command pane. The affected ships
must be in the same location.

## WARP SPEED

A fleet’s warp speed determines the number of years it takes to reach a
waypoint, as well as fuel usage. Actual distance traveled is the square of the
warp speed. For example, a fleet traveling at Warp 8 will move up to 64 light
years each turn.

### The Fleet Waypoints tile always suggest an optimum speed to reach the

waypoint, using the least amount of fuel to deliver the fleet in the shortest       Learn more about

starbase or the fleet has Scrap Fleet or Colonize orders, or includes a hull with
a colony pod, the fleet travels at the maximum possible speed for its engine
and fuel supply.

### Maximum Speed

All engines have an absolute maximum speed, a maximum safe speed, a
maximum free speed and an optimum speed.

The absolute maximum speed for all engines is warp 10. The maximum safe
speed for most ships is warp 9. You can push your fleet to warp 10, but you’ll
have a 10% chance of losing each ship in the fleet at that speed. Only ships
using warp 10 capable engines can travel safely at warp 10. You can tell if an
engine is warp 10 capable by viewing it in the Technology Browser and
seeing if the area between warp 9 and 10 is covered with a yellow warning
pattern or not.

For most standard engines the maximum free speed is warp 1. This means that
you can travel at warp 1 using no fuel.

### For standard engines the optimum or best warp speed is the maximum speed

at less than 120% fuel usage. For Ramscoop engines the best warp speed is
the maximum speed that the engine can travel using no fuel. To learn the best
speed for a specific engine, visit the Engines section of the Technology
Browser. The Fuel Usage vs. Warp Speed graphs in the Browser shows this
speed for each engine. The following graph shows that the best warp speed
for this engine is warp 6.

The grid between warp 9 and 10 shows that the ship using that engine has a
10% chance of self-destructing while traveling at warp 10.

Travel Warp 1 without Using Fuel
Any ship can travel Warp 1 without using fuel. This means you travel 1 light
year per year of play. You also generate tiny amounts of fuel at Warp 1, and
may be able to put on small bursts of speed. This really is helpful only if
you’re close to your destination, almost out of fuel, and don’t want to bother
sending a rescue ship.

## FINDING A SPECIFIC FLEET

The simplest way to locate a planet or fleet is to use the Find command. Use
either the Command (Find) menu item, or press CTRL-F.

To find a fleet of your own, do one of the following:
- Enter the fleet number using any format (fleet #58, fleet 58, #58, 58).
- Enter the full name of the fleet.

To find another player ’s fleet:
- Enter the fleet identification using this format:

race_name fleet #fleet_number

If Stars! says it cannot find a planet or fleet by that name, try again, making
sure you type the correct name or number, or that you used the correct format
for finding another player ’s fleet. If you still can’t find a fleet, it may no longer
exist.

## USING FUEL

### Fuel is a manufactured commodity made of anti-matter and is measured in

milligrams (mg). This means it has little effect on the ship’s mass (and thus, fuel usage). Fuel can only be obtained from starbases with ship building
capability or from other fleets. It is also created by ships traveling at their
engine’s free speed, by fuel tankers and by ships with Anti-Matter Generators.

Fuel is shared by all ships in a fleet. The fuel capacity of a fleet is the sum of
the fuel capacity for each ship in the fleet. The rate at which fuel is used is
based partially on the mass of all ships and cargo in the fleet. Fuel usage is
also based on the rate at which each ship in the fleet uses fuel at a given
speed. All ship types can move at any speed, but they each burn different
amounts of fuel to achieve that speed. The total fuel usage for the fleet is the
sum of the fuel usage for all the individual ships.

Ship_fuel_usage = (ship_mass x efficiency x distance / 200 + 9) / 10

Fuel usage between waypoints is shown in the Fleet Waypoints tile. The
amount shown for reaching the selected waypoint is always exact.

### Estimated Fuel Usage for

travel from the current
waypoint to the fleet named
Perfect Logic #163, with
speed set to Warp 8.

### Sometimes Slowing Down Uses More Fuel

Each year’s travel is a separate jump that uses a finite, countable number of
milligrams of fuel. Let’s say that you have a fleet that can travel at warp 5 for
3mg per year of travel. A journey of 100ly would take 4 years and use 12mg
of fuel. If you slowed down to warp 4 it would only cost 2mg per year of
travel but the journey would take 7 years for a total of 14mg of fuel. This is a
case where it is more economical to go at the faster speed.

### Route Behavior

If the route destination is an uncolonized planet and fleet includes remote
miners, its orders are automatically changed at the destination to Remote
Mining. If the route destination is a planet with your mining fleet already in
orbit, the final waypoint task is automatically changed to Merge with Fleet.

Route will not auto-colonize at the destination. You must specify colonization
orders upon the fleet’s arrival.

## RENDEZVOUSING FLEETS

It’s useful to specify one fleet as a destination for another if you are
transferring cargo between fleets (for example, between a remote miner and a
freighter), merging fleets, or chasing an opponent’s fleet.

To rendezvous one fleet with another, just select the current position of the
destination fleet as the waypoint for the fleet that wishes to intercept it. As
long as the destination fleet can be detected by the pursuing fleet’s scanner, this fleet will follow the destination fleet until it overtakes it or runs out of
fuel. If the fleet in pursuit loses sight of the destination fleet, it travels to the
destination fleet’s last known position.

## WORMHOLE NAVIGATION

### Wormholes are spacial anomalies that appear and disappear at

whim. There are several types, some more stable than others.

### Wormholes offer you free travel across huge distances of space

and have no limitations on ship or cargo mass.

Wormholes appear only in deep space, being somewhat repelled by the
gravity wells caused by a planet.

Wormhole stability ranges from Rock Solid to Very Unstable. Rock Solid
wormholes can stay in one general area for 30 years or more. Very Unstable
wormholes tend to move to a different area within about five years.

Each end of the wormhole moves independently. Due to their complex
nature, wormholes jiggle a bit every year. Their exact location is always
shifting.

12               COLONIZATION

### Colonize planets that are immediately habitable by you or that have a

negative value but can be terraformed to become habitable. You should
colonize as many planets as possible in order to increase the rate at which
you gain resources, which you need to build better technology and more
fleets. At the same time, don’t pull people off your home world so fast that
you begin to lose significant resources. Try to find a balance between the
planet’s growth rate and the rate at which you send colonists off-planet.

## CHOOSING PLANETS TO COLONIZE

Planets come in three basic flavors:

Planets you can inhabit immediately . These have a positive value, and appear
green in Planet Value view in the scanner. The better the planet, the higher
the value, and the larger the green dot. The higher the value, the faster your
colony will grow.

## COLONIZING AN UNINHABITED PLANET

To colonize an uninhabited planet, you need a fleet containing at least one
ship with a colonization module as part of the hull design. Most races start
with at least one colonizer. If you don’t have any colony ships, add one or
more to your production queue.                                                      Learn about:

The colonists will dismantle the colony ship when they land, using any
leftover cargo and some of the minerals used in the ship construction to help
start the colony.

It’s usually a good idea to minimize the number of ships in the colonization
fleet. Once the colony is established you can transport additional colonists
using a freighter (colonists are unloaded, and the freighter proceeds to its next
waypoint).

The colonization module is pictured in the margin. For a better picture, press

13                MINING

Most of a planet’s minerals lay under the surface, unavailable for use until
your colonists mine them. You can build mines on your own worlds, or use
robot miners to mine uninhabited worlds.

### The mineral content and concentrations for a planet are shown in the

Selection Summary pane and the Minerals on Hand tile. The number of mines
that have been built and can be operated appear in the Minerals on Hand tile.

2. Look at the mineral concentration information in the Selection Summary
pane and the Minerals on Hand tile. Click on the mineral name or value
in either of these locations to display information on the density of each
mineral under the surface.
3. Calculate productivity using this formula:

potential productivity, mineral concentration = actual productivity

For example, you learn from the View Race dialog that 10 mines produce
up to 10 kT per year, and from the Mineral Content graph in the Selection
Summary that Germanium concentration is 50. This means 100 mines
will produce 50 kT of Germanium in the next year. In this case, you
would have to add two mines for every additional kT of Germanium you
want each year.

## CALCULATING THE RATE OF DECREASE IN MINERAL

### CONCENTRATION

The decrease in mineral concentration is related solely to the number of
mines operating on a planet and the number of years the mines have been in
operation. For two players with the same number of mines operating over the
same number of years, the decrease in concentration will be the same for
each.

Think about it in terms of Mine years: One Mine year means the operation of
one mine on a planet in a year. If you are operating 50 mines per year on a
planet, that equates to 50 Mine years.

## TRANSFERRING FUEL AND CARGO TO OTHER FLEETS

Fuel and minerals can be transferred between fleets. These fleets can belong
to you or an opponent. Once given, the fuel or cargo cannot be taken back.
This opens up possibilities for trade (as part of a diplomatic strategy).

Fuel and minerals can also be transferred from any player’s fleet to any
player’s planet. However, if one player attempts to transfer colonists to
another player’s planet (regardless of their relationship), that’s called an
invasion, and dealt with in the expected manner.

Transfer cargo using one of the cargo transfer dialogs. These are accessible
from several tiles in the Command pane.

## JETTISONING CARGO

As indicated by the Location tile above, you must be in deep space to jettison
cargo. Jettison if you don’t have enough fuel, must reach your destination or
make a fast getaway, and can’t wait for another ship to reach you with fuel.

TR ANS POR T ING FR E IG HT   14-3

Transferring cargo to an opponent’s ship or a planet you don’t own effectively
does the same thing: you lose the cargo. Jettisoned cargo is lost to the cosmos.

You cannot jettison cargo if there is salvage at the same location.

## CREATING A CUSTOM TRANSPORT ZIP ORDER

can add up to four custom zip orders.

Once you create a Custom Zip Order, it becomes available in all your games
until you delete it. Here’s how to create one:
1. Specify the Transport order in the Waypoint Task tile.
2. Set up the order you wish to add to the Zip Order list by selecting the
appropriate cargo items and operations.
3. Right-click on the blue diamond in the Waypoint Task tile.
4. Select <Customize> from the pop-up menu. The Custom Zip Orders

By default, new armed fleets start out with attack orders. Since these orders
are always in effect, your armed fleets can also be assigned any waypoint task

### Firing in Passing

If a ship moves in the direction of its primary target but is still out of range, it
will try and fire on any target within range. The primary target is specified in
the Battle Plans dialog.

### Salvage from Space Battles

Ships destroyed in battle or by minefields leave salvage. Cargo is dumped in
space as a mineral packet or, if the battle took place in orbit, the cargo falls to
the surface of the planet. Players who survive a battle against technologically
superior ships have up to a 50% chance of automatically advancing one level
in one field of technology. The technology bonus is based on sensor readings
rather than salvage. In order to recover the minerals from a salvage packet for
use in production:
1. Set the salvage packet as a waypoint (if you aren’t there already).
2. When you arrive, choose the packets from the dropdown list in the Other

## GROUND COMBAT

To invade another player ’s planet and initiate ground combat:
1. Build a fleet with one or more freighters.
2. In the Waypoint Task tile, use the Transport task to load colonists onto the

## CLAIM ADJUSTERS AND TERRAFORMING AS A WEAPON

### Races based on the Claim Adjuster trait can perform negative terraforming on

an enemy’s planet while in orbit. If the planet has a starbase, you must
destroy it before you can begin this type of attack.

### Orbital Terraforming

Terraforming from orbit requires a fleet outfitted with Orbital Adjusters. These
are described in the Mining Robots section of the Technology Browser. Every
race with the Claim Adjuster trait starts out with one ship outfitted with
Orbital Adjusters.                                                                 Orbital Adjuster

Terraforming from orbit can also be used as a weapon: just orbit the planet
and start to terraform it under your opponent’s feet. This allows you to prepare
more favorable conditions for a planetary invasion. Depending on your
opponent’s level of terraforming technology, using terraforming as an attack
could turn into a shoving match if they begin terraforming operations of their
own.

Terraforming from orbit happens automatically as soon as your fleet arrives.
Just set the destination planet as the fleet waypoint. No waypoint task is
necessary. Your fleets will automatically perform negative terraforming for
Enemies and positive terraforming for friends.

### Retro Bomb

Claim Adjusters also can gain the Retro bomb, a type of terraforming weapon
used to return the planet to its original conditions. This is useful if you know
your opponent has been working hard to change the habitability value of the        Retro Bomb
planet, and especially if the original planetary environment was more suitable
for your race than the current environment.

## DECLARING ENEMIES AND FRIENDS

In a single player game, everyone is your enemy. In a multi-player game, you
designate who you do and do not wish to attack.
- Select Player Relations from the Commands menu to specify your
enemies, your friends, and races you have no feelings for whatsoever
(neutral).

CO MB AT   15-11

When you give a fleet attack orders you can choose who to attack: all
enemies, all neutrals and enemies, everybody or a just a specific opponent.

Friends are also immune to your minefields, automatically refuel at your
starbases and are allowed to use your stargates.

Fleets with the waypoint task of Patrol will only attack Enemies.

### Unwilling Participants and Innocent Bystanders

If you declare another player to be your friend you may be unexpectedly
drawn into battles. If a friend of yours is attacked and you have a fleet at the
same location your fleet will automatically join the battle even if it does not
have attack orders. Yegads.

If both players are your friends, you can sit on the sidelines and watch or be
on your merry way.

## BATTLE PLANS

Battle plans specify the behavior of your ships in a confrontation. When you
specify attack orders, you choose a battle plan that defines the attack and
defense.
- Modify or delete an existing plan, or create a new plan, using the
Commands (Battle Plans ) menu item.

Stars! provides several pre-defined battle plans to help you start. To learn the
contents of a plan, select it from the list in the Battle Plans dialog. Then look

useful for crippling enemy battle groups while attempting to avoid their heavy
guns.

Primary target: Armed Ships; Secondary target: None/Disengage

### This would try to take out all enemy armed ships and the armed enemy

starbase, leaving unarmed ships alone. This is useful if you plan on stealing
cargo from the unarmed ships (assuming you survive).

Primary target: Armed Ships; Secondary target: Bombers/Freighters
This ignores anything that isn’t armed, or a bomber or freighter. This prevents
you from wasting shots on harmless ships.

Make sure your battle plan reflects what you really want your ships to do. For
example, if you specify a target of Any and the closest ship happens to be an
unarmed freighter instead of the enemy’s battleships, you will waste a round
destroying an easy target while the opponent’s battleships pound you into
space dust. In this case, choosing a target of Armed Ships would be much
more appropriate.

### Battle Tactics

A fleet’s battle plan lists a tactic for each general target type: Any, Armed
Ships, Starbase, etc. Tactics fall into three styles: disengage, minimize personal
damage, and maximize opponent damage. Each tactic determines how much
damage each token, or group of ships of the same design, will attempt to both
inflict and expose itself to.

### In all cases except Disengage the token will attempt to get closer to the target

if it is currently outside maximum range. If the token runs out of primary and
secondary targets it will automatically switch to Disengage. If a token can no
longer do any damage it will automatically Disengage. For example if the
attacking token has shield buster weapons only and none of the enemy tokens
have shields, the attacker will disengage.

### Maximize Damage Ratio will not necessarily close to what may be considered

the best location for you ship’s weapons if it is carrying both short and long
range weapons. For example, if you design a cruiser that carries range 6
missiles and a range 2 beam weapon, odds are that you will never get closer
than range 6 in the battle. This is an advantage if when you want to use the
short range weapons strictly as a deterrent against fast ships that try to get in
close and destroy you with their short range weapons. If you do want to get
closer and bring all weapons to bear, use Maximize Net Damage or Maximize
Damage tactics.

16               PATROLLING

While on Patrol, your fleet will automatically intercept and attack any
incoming enemy fleets within a specified range. Fleets on patrol will not target
neutrals or friends.

## ASSIGNING PATROL ORDERS

To place a fleet on patrol duty:
1. Give the fleet one waypoint in the scanner.
2. In the Waypoints Task tile, select the Patrol task.
3. Select an Intercept Range. Your fleet will only attempt to intercept enemy
fleets it detects within the specified range.
4. Set the intercept speed using the warp factor gauge, or accept the default
of Automatic. The default chooses the optimum speed (attempting a speed
that uses the least amount of fuel to intercept in the shortest possible
time). You will be notified when a patrolling fleet is given a new target
and can adjust the warp speed or retarget it before the intercept happens.
5. Set any additional waypoints. The Patrol order will be carried out
automatically for each waypoint, until you assign a different task.

16-2    PLAYI NG STARS !
- To station a patrol at a particular location, send the fleet to that location
and then give it the Patrol task and select the Repeat Orders checkbox in
the Fleet Waypoints tile.

### The fleet will only target enemies within its Intercept Range from that

point and will automatically return there after the intercept.

## PATROL TARGETS ENEMIES ONLY

Fleets on patrol will only intercept and attack Enemy fleets. In a single player
game against AIs, all other players are your enemies. In a multi-player game, you can choose who is your enemy, friend or a neutral.

To make a player your enemy in a multi-player game:
1. Choose Commands (Player Relations ), opening the Player Relations
dialog.
2. Select the player in the dropdown list, then click on Enemy.
3. OK the dialog.

Patrol does not immediately target an enemy fleet. Targeting occurs after all
players move, as one of the last tasks in generating a new turn. This allows
you to receive a message and inspect the patrol order that was given, altering
it if necessary before the ship commits to the attack.

### If you want the ship to patrol and attack a particular enemy fleet you see right

now, simply add a waypoint at the enemy fleet with orders to Patrol at that
ship.

PATR O LLIN G        16-3

## PATROL AND BATTLE PLANS

Patrol takes battle plans into account when deciding who to intercept. Your
primary target will be matched according to its hull type. For example, if you
target unarmed ships, your patrol fleet will only target fleets guaranteed to be
unarmed. You would not target a battleship, even if you’ve fought it before
and know that it doesn’t have any weapons on board.                                Learn more about

The same calculation applies to planet penetrating scanners.

### Scanners and Primary Traits

Some races have extra scanner technology. For example, if you’ve chosen
Packet Physics as your primary trait, all your mineral packets will act as
planet-penetrating scanners. If you choose Space Demolition all your
minefields act as normal scanners.

## SELECTING FLEETS IN THE SCANNER PANE

Fleets in orbit are indicated by a circle around the planet. To select a fleet in
orbit:
1. Right click on the planet in the Scanner pane.
2. Select the enemy fleet from the pop-up list.

Follow the same procedure to select a fleet from a group in deep space.

Estimated Path of Another Player ’s Fleet

Click in the Scanner on an opponent’s fleet to display its estimated path. The
arrow points in the approximate direction of travel. Tick marks appear on the
line indicating how far the fleet will move in a year at its current speed. Since
a fleet travels in a straight line from waypoint to waypoint, you can use this
path to estimate the fleet’s origin and destination.

Using the opponent’s fleet summary and estimated path, you can guess at the
types of activities your wily foe or friend is up to. For example, if you select a
fleet of attack ships, you can meet them in battle, and have a better idea of
where those attack fleets are coming from and thus, where to aim your own
big guns or to lay minefields. If the selected fleets tend to be scouts, miners or
colonists, you’ll have a clue to their current strategy and possible needs.

## SCANNING PLANETS

When you scan an uninhabited planet, you’ll be able to detect the
environment and the concentration of each mineral under the planet surface, but not the minerals stored on the surface. If you attempt to scan a planet
inhabited by an opponent, you can detect only the environment, underground
mineral concentration and an estimate of the population (plus or minus 20%).

If the planet’s starbase has cloaks, the distance at which you can detect the
enemy’s starbase is reduced.

17-4    PLAYI NG ST ARS !

CLOAKING, OR HIDING FROM OPPONENTS’ SCANNERS
Cloaking devices allow you to reduce your opponent’s effective
scanner range in detecting your cloaked fleet or planet. Cloaking
devices do not make your fleet or planet invisible: no matter how
strong the cloak, the object will always be visible to another fleet at the same
location.

Cloaking reduces your opponent’s scanner range by a specific percentage.
The higher the percentage, the more the range is reduced. The maximum              For a description of

Uncloaked ships are also hidden in a cloaked fleet, although they do reduce

Cloaks are additive. Additional cloaks reduce your fleet’s visibility.

### Types of Cloaks

There are several types of cloaking devices. If your race is based on the Super-

### Having scanners on as many planets as possible reduces the chance that

cloaked fleets will sneak past. For example, if your opponent has 75%
cloaking, and your scanners normally detect fleets at a range of 200 light
years, your effective scanning range will be reduced to 50 light years. If your
scanners are close together, whether they be planet-based, ship-based, or a

SCAN NI NG AND CLO AKI N G            17-5

combination, you’ll create a gauntlet that opponents’ships aren’t as likely to
sneak through undetected.

Also consider placing sentry ships at uninhabited planets along your border.
They will help prevent any unseen planet-hopping by your opponents. Even if
a ship is cloaked, you will still detect it when it passes by.

### The X series of planet-based scanners and certain ship-based scanners can

detect both fleets in deep space and fleets in orbit. Both these ranges are
affected by cloaking. For example, if you are using a Snooper 250X planet-
based scanner against a 75% cloak, the scanner will have effective ranges of
62 light years and 31 light years. If the ship is in orbit of a planet 32 light
years away, you won’t see it.

With the Scanner’s Radar Overlay turned on, ask yourself: Will there be gaps
in my coverage if each scanner only sees    as far? What about     as far?

### Adjust the percentage to determine what your coverage would be relative to

the cloaking ability of opponents’ships.

For example, select 75% to show how close a fleet with
25% cloaking will need to be before you can detect it.

Keep in mind that a cloak only reduces a scanner’s effectiveness in detecting
the cloaked fleet. It fools the scanner, rather than physically changing it.

### Tachyon Detector

You must have the Inner Strength trait to use this device.

### Each Tachyon Detector reduces the effectiveness of other players cloak by

5%. The reduction is only seen by the fleet carrying the detector. The affect of
multiple detectors is additive. If a fleet has two detectors, the first lowers the

### Tachyon Detector

effectiveness of the opponent’s cloak to 95%, the second detector takes the
95% and reduces it almost another 5%, down to 90.2%. This makes it

17-6    PLAYI NG ST ARS !

significantly harder for enemies to sneak past fleets carrying this device. A
great option for ships on regular patrol duty.

When you add a Tachyon Detector to a hull design, the Ship and Starbase
Designer displays other player ’s cloaking effectiveness on the design’s scanner
information line.

### PIRATING USING STEALTH-BASED SCANNERS

19               DIPLOMACY AND TRADE

### Multi-player games only

Stars! has features that allow you to practice diplomacy in multi-player games.
Use the mail feature of the Message pane to communicate with other players, arranging alliances, rendezvous, trade agreements, joint remote mining
ventures, and non-aggression pacts. (Stars! mail works equally well for hurling
insults and taunts.)

Stars! does not require one winner. When you’re setting up the game, you can
specify winning conditions that encourage diplomacy by allowing for multiple
winners.

## PLAYER RELATIONSHIPS

You can declare neutral and friendly players using the Player Relations dialog.

### This prevents you from attacking the wrong people and allows you to

automatically come to a friend’s aid if they’re under fire. Friends can also pass
through each other’s mine fields without harm, automatically refuel at their
starbases and are allowed to use their stargates. So it’s worthwhile to set up
alliances, even if they’re temporary.

## TRADING FUEL AND MINERALS

You can also trade fuel and minerals with other players, sending messages to
arrange the trade, then rendezvouing with the other player’s fleet to give or
receive minerals or fuel. Minerals can also be sent to another player’s planet
using a fleet-to-planet transfer or by flinging mineral packets to the planet
(assuming the receiving planet has a mass driver of equal or greater strength—
otherwise you might have a war on your hands).

19-2    P LAY I NG STARS !

### Fleet-related trades can be automated by setting your waypoints between

planets or fleets, specifying Transport orders, then selecting Repeat Orders.
Automate mineral packet-based trade by adding Mineral Packets (Auto Build)
to your production queue and aiming the mass driver at the correct planet.

## TRADING TECHNOLOGY

### It is also possible to trade technological research data by scrapping fleets at

each other’s starbases. While this is not always 100% successful, due to the
differences in each race’s basic understanding of the laws of physics, it is a
great way to add spice to an alliance.

## TRADING SHIPS

You can give fleets to other players using the Transfer Fleets waypoint task.

### The other player can take the fleet if doing so would not cause them to

exceed the maximum number of ship designs. The receiving player cannot
build additional ships of the types given by other players. They can, however, receive additional ships of the same type from the other player.

## TRADING WITH TRANSDIMENSIONAL BEINGS

### You might encounter a transdimensional being with technology to sell during

the course of a game. If you can catch this Mystery Trader and give it what it
wants, you may learn about technology that neither you nor any other player
would normally be able to research and build.

## JOINT MINING VENTURES

You can join with other players to remote mine a planet, each player using
their own remote mining fleet and freighters or, since minerals can be
transferred between different players fleets and planets, one player may mine
then manually transfer the minerals to the other player’s holds for transports to
the agreed upon ports-o-call.

Any Super Stealth race can automate transferring cargo from another player’s
mining fleet as a waypoint task—if the other player agrees, it’s diplomacy;
otherwise, it’s piracy.

## CLAIM ADJUSTERS AND ORBITAL TERRAFORMING

Races based on the Claim Adjuster trait can terraform other player’s planets
from orbit. This creates unique opportunities for diplomacy or war. If the
owner is your Friend, you perform positive terraforming (adjusting planetary
conditions toward the inhabitants’optimal conditions). If the owner is your
Enemy, you perform negative terraforming.

Terraforming from orbit happens automatically as soon as your fleet arrives.
Just set the destination planet as the fleet waypoint. No waypoint task is
necessary.

### Terraforming for Hire

Terraforming from orbit requires a fleet outfitted with Orbital Adjusters. These
are described in the Mining Robots section of the Technology Browser. Every
race with the Claim Adjuster trait starts out with one ship outfitted with
Orbital Adjusters.

Terraforming from orbit is a great vehicle for diplomacy: in return for other      Specify Friends, technology, an alliance, or just a plain ‘thank you’, you can help your friends    Enemies and

additive—you can’t combine your orbital terraforming abilities with those of
the inhabitants to super terraform the planet. The planet will only be
terraformed to the limits of whoever possesses the superior technology. For
example, if the inhabitants have 3% terraforming and you possess 5%
terraforming, the planet can be improved up to 5% from its original
conditions (not exceeding optimal conditions for the inhabitants).

STEP 1: BASIC RACE DEFINITION

### Race Name and Password

Name your race and if you wish, choose a password. The password chosen
when a race is created is attached to the race file. While you may change the
password during the game, that change applies only to the current game.

### Opening that race file for use in another game will require proper entry of the

original password. In order to view or edit the race file, you also need the
password. You may specify a race name only here in step 1.

### Predefined Races

Selecting a predefined race automatically presets all of the options in steps 2
through 6. Choosing a predefined race doesn’t prevent you from changing any
option — they are only provided as a time saver. Each predefined race has
specific strengths and weaknesses you can use in determining your playing
style and strategies.

### Use the Custom Race wizard to learn about the pre-selected attributes for

each predefined race and use a race as a starting point for one of your own:
1. Select each predefined race in turn.
2. Use the Back and Next buttons to step through the wizard, noting the
settings.
3. Go back to step 1 and select the predefined race that looked the best for       Read more about
your purposes.                                                                  the predefined
races in chapter 21.
4. Fine tune that race using as much of the wizard as necessary.

### Other Basic Definition Options

Leftover Advantage Points — Surface Minerals
You will get 10kT of surface minerals for each leftover advantage point. For
example, if there are 20 unused points, you would receive a total of 200kT of
minerals. Stars! weights the distribution in favor of the rarest minerals. These
will be available immediately.

Leftover Advantage Points — Mines
You will get one additional mine for every two leftover advantage points.
These will be available immediately.

Leftover Advantage Points – Mineral Concentration

### The concentration of the mineral on your home world that would have been

poorest is improved by 1% for every 3 leftover advantage points. Increasing
the concentration increases the rate at which the mineral is mined (mining, of
course, reducing the concentration over time).

### Race Emblem

Select a race emblem from the collection. This emblem identifies your fleets
when they are displayed in the Selection Summary pane. In a multi-player
game you may not get the emblem you select if another player chooses the
same emblem.

checked

D ESI GN IN G CU ST OMR ACE S   20-11

STEP 3: LESSER TRAITS
Specify/view the lesser traits for your race. You’ll probably find several traits
that won’t affect your playing strategy. Each time you choose a trait that
prevents you from developing something, you’ll gain advantage points you’ll
be able to use elsewhere or, if you’re in the hole, bring the balance closer to
being above zero (you have to be above or at zero before you can click on
Finish).

Select lesser traits that compliment the profile you chose in step 2:

### Improved Fuel Efficiency trait

Your ships will burn 15% less fuel than what the drive specifications indicate.
The Fuel Mizer and the Galaxy Scoop engines are also available. This trait
also increases your starting tech in propulsion by one level.

### Total Terraforming trait

You begin the game with the ability to adjust each of a planet’s environment
attributes by up to 3% in either direction. Throughout the game, additional
terraforming technologies not available to other players will be achievable, up
to 30% terraforming. Total Terraforming requires 30% fewer resources.

### Advanced Remote Mining trait

Gives you three additional mining hulls and two new robots. You will start the
game with two Midget Miners.

### Improved Starbases trait

Gives you two new starbase designs. The Space Dock hull allows you to build
starbases which can in turn build small to medium ships. The Ultra-Station is
much larger than a standard Starbase. Your starbases are automatically
cloaked by 20%. Starbases will cost you 20% less to build.

### Generalized Research trait

Your race takes a holistic approach to research. Only half of the resources
dedicated to research will be applied to the current field of research. 15% of
the total will be applied to each of the fields. (Yes, we know this adds up to
115%.)

20-12    R ACE C R EATIO N

### Ultimate Recycling trait

When you scrap a fleet at a starbase, you recover 90% of the minerals and
70% of the resources used to produce the fleet. The resources are available
for use the next year. Scrapping at a planet gives you 45% of the minerals and
35% of the resources.

These resources are not strictly additive. The number a planet receives is
determined by the formula:

Resources = (Current_production x Extra_resources) /
(Current_production + Extra_resources)

This formula is true whether or not a planet has a starbase.

### Mineral Alchemy trait

You will be able to turn resources into minerals more efficiently. One instance
of mineral alchemy will use 25 resources to produce one kT of each mineral.
Without this trait it takes 100 resources to produce one kT of each mineral.

### No Ramscoop Engines trait

You will not be able to build the Radiating Hydro-Ram Scoop, Sub-Galactic
Fuel Scoop, Trans-Galactic Fuel Scoop, Trans-Galactic Super Scoop, Trans-
Galactic Mizer Scoop or the Galaxy Scoop. You will be able to build the
Interspace-10 engine, which can travel warp 10 without taking damage.

### Cheap Engines trait

Pro: Engines cost 50% less to build.

Con: Your ship engines aren’t entirely reliable. When attempting to travel at
speeds above warp 6, there is a 10% chance the engines will refuse to
engage.

### Only Basic Remote Mining trait

No Robo-Miner, Robo-Maxi-Miner or Robo-Super-Miner robots.

### No Advanced Scanners

You will not have any standard scanners that can scan planets from a distance
and see fleets hiding behind planets. All ranges for conventional scanners are
doubled.

D ESI GN IN G CU ST OM RACE S   20-13

### Low Starting Population trait

Instead of 25000 people, you start with 17500 (30% fewer). It takes a long
time to overcome a lower starting population — it helps to have a high
growth rate, but even then it can be painful.

### Bleeding Edge Technology trait

New technologies initially cost twice as much to build. As soon as you
exceed all of the tech requirements by one level, the cost drops back to
normal. Miniaturization, the lowering of production costs, occurs at 5% per
level, up to 80%. Without this trait miniaturization occurs at 4% and tops out
at 75%.

### Regenerating Shields trait

All shields are 40% stronger than the listed rating. Shields regenerate at 10%
of the maximum strength after every round of battle. All armors are at 50% of
their rated strength.

STEP 4: POPULATION GROWTH FACTORS
Specify your race’s habitable range and its growth rate under optimum
conditions, using the following topics as guidelines:

### Growth Conditions

Use this step to specify how well your race tolerates gravity, temperature and
radiation. The tolerances are set individually for each of the three
environmental factors.

The width of the colored bar represents the extent of the habitable range. The
width plus the position of the bar left or right determine the extremes of the
habitable range. The numbers to the right of the bar show the extremes in
either gravities (g), degrees Celsius (C) or millirads (mR).

### Your race will grow only on planets with conditions that fall within the

habitable ranges. On planets that are outside the habitable ranges, some
colonists will die every year due to the unbearable conditions.

20-14    R ACE CR EAT IO N

The gravity and temperature of every planet are picked at random, but are
slightly weighted to favor values in the middle of the spectrum. If you move
the colored bar away from the center, the advantage points increase, compensating for the reduction in the number of habitable planets you will
encounter. The radiation level of a planet is chosen completely at random.

### Adjusting the Habitable Range

If you click on     or      the entire range moves left or right. Holding down
the SHIFT key while clicking moves the range in steps. Click and hold the
colored bar to drag it back and forth freestyle.

Clicking             widens the habitable range. Clicking           narrows
the habitable range. Holding down the SHIFT key while clicking narrows and
widens the range in 20% increments.

### Choosing an Extreme Range

Cons: The more extreme your habitability range, the more planets will be out
of your habitable and terraformable range.

Pros: You get back advantage points. Also, planets with environments near the
ends of the spectrum have a good chance of being super-rich in one or more
minerals. For example, a planet with a flesh-searing radiation extreme of
97mR could easily have four times the concentration of each mineral as a
mild-mannered vacation world.

### Immunity

Selecting the Immune to Radiation checkbox allows you to ignore an
environmental factor. This is very expensive and will require the selection of
many disadvantages to bring advantage points back above zero. When you
select immunity, the habitable range becomes irrelevant and disappears. If
you select any kind of immunity, you may not want to spend points on the
Total Terraforming advantage. Once you’re in the game, you can research
individual terraforming technologies that apply only to environmental factors
that can affect you. If you are totally immune, you never need to terraform.

D ESI GN IN GCU STO M R ACE S   20-15

### Selecting immunity is different than expanding the habitable range to fill the

entire spectrum. Immunity treats every point in the spectrum as 100% ideal. A
range widened to fill the spectrum treats only the mid-point as 100% ideal.
The edges of the range are 0% ideal.

### Maximum Population Growth

Set the maximum colonist growth rate between 1% and 20% per year. The
colonists will grow at this rate only if the habitability value is 100%. If the
habitability value is less than 100%, the colonist growth rate will fall
proportionately.

For example:

If your people decide to colonize Demski, a rock with a habitability value of
15%.

### Clicking on the Value in the Selection

Summary pane for the planet Demski
displays this popup:

If you are immune to an environmental factor, every planet you explore will
be 100% ideal for that factor. Immunity is expensive. You will have to choose
many disadvantages in order to compensate and bring the advantage point
value back above zero.

If you select both immunity and the advantage of Total Terraforming, some or
all of the points used to obtain the Total Terraforming advantage will be
wasted.

installations.

providing an advantage, watch the advantage points box as you click on the
controls. If the number of points decreases when you click on a control, you
have given the race an advantage.

### Sample Strategies

If you have a race with a high population growth, you may not care about
being efficient with factories. In this case you would set the controls so
colonists produce fewer and more expensive factories, thereby freeing up
advantage points to use somewhere else.

If you don’t plan on building a lot of mines, or if you have extra advantage
points, consider increasing the mining production rate. This will NOT affect
the rate at which the mineral concentration is reduced on your planets. It only
makes you more efficient at squeezing minerals out of the rock. This can give
you a competitive advantage over a player who operates more mines but is
less efficient—they’ll decrease their mineral concentration faster than you.
The rate at which mineral concentration decreases (always stopping at 1) is
determined by the number of mines on a planet and the number of years
they’ve been in existence.

### Keep in mind that when the mineral concentrations on both your planets and

your opponent’s planets reaches 1, the player with more mines can do as
well, and possibly better, than the player who is very efficient at extraction. If
you’re very good at production and are creating resources like crazy, you may
find you can easily make up for low mineral concentrations with Mineral
Alchemy.

D ESIGN IN G CU ST OM RACE S            20-17

These are only simple examples of possible strategies—make the choices that
suit your game the best, keeping in mind the rules determining the rate at
which mineral concentration is reduced.

Next you’ll specify the cost of research for your race.

STEP 6: RESEARCH COSTS
Specify/view how efficiently your scientists use planetary resources in their
research. Changes are reflected in the advantage points box in the upper-right
corner of the dialog.

Selecting Costs 75% Extra increases the available advantage points.

Selecting Costs 50% Less decreases the available advantage points.

If you check All ‘Costs 75% Extra’ Research Fields Start at Tech 3, then it is to   If you have chosen
your advantage to have as many research fields ‘Costs 75% Extra’ as makes           the Jack-of-All-

Tech 4’.

## FINISH

When you finish Stars! will ask you to save the race to a file, suggesting a file
extension of .r1. This is just a default—you can name a race file anything you
wish. If you are editing an existing race, you will be asked to save it to that
file name or a new name.

### Social Traits

Fast growing, generally peaceable, good at research and mining.

Best Universe Size/Game Difficulty
Against AIs, Antethereals do their best in a small universe, in an easy or
medium game. It suffers in a large universe, at any level of difficulty, and in a
medium+ universe in a hard+ game.

### Advantages

Reproduces fairly fast. Research is cheaper than for most races. Efficient in
production and remote mining operations. Able to lay vast mine fields from
the very start.

21-2    R AC ECR EATI O N

### Disadvantages

Tiny survival range—you won’t find many planets you can colonize. Can’t use
advanced war-related technology. Unable to use penetrating scanners and
engine technology is sometimes unreliable.

### Strategies

Research for defensive hull types, long range weapons, propulsion (fast
engines), construction (large cargo capacity).

Auto-build factories, then mines, then factories, until you find a better
production strategy.

Explore as fast as possible.

Lay lots of overlapping small mine fields. Remote detonate them when
unsuspecting enemies get within their confines.

Build remote miners and freighters. Put ramscoops on the freighters to
optimize fuel use and maximize speed.

Concentrate of remote mining. You can’t be an Antethereal and
environmentally conscientious at the same time. Strip-mine planets you can’t
colonize, using freighters to transport the minerals to your populated worlds.
Be sure to assign the mining fleet itself as a waypoint, so freighters will follow
the fleet

Put attack scout in orbit with remote miners, preventing easy colonization
from opponents and an attack on your miner. Don’t place the scout in the
same fleet as the miner, though. Attach armed escorts to your freighters to
protect them from attack as well.

On habitable planets, use remote miners for a few turns before colonizing, dumping all the mined minerals on the planet surface so the colonists have a
large supply immediately available.

Win by out-researching your opponents. Since you’ll concentrate on remote
mining, invest in construction to build the biggest, most efficient remote
miners possible.

Build very advanced, long range weapons. Avoid direct confrontations, building only as many warships as you need for defense.

PREDEFINED RACES   21-3

## HUMANOIDS

### Physical Traits

Thin skin, rudimentary senses, efficient fat storage capabilities.

### Social Traits

Over promoted. The absolute average race, with no special abilities or
disabilities. Can swing either way, playing a defensive game that focuses on
outgrowing and outproducing opponents, or an offensive game that focuses
on crushing opponents through military might.

Best Universe/Game Size
Has the potential to do well in any size of universe.

### Advantages

High growth rate, a pretty good habitable range. Lots of ships to start the
game with. No serious disadvantages.

### Disadvantages

They have no serious advantages, either. And they’re dull.

### Strategies

Try to determine the attributes of your opponents and adjust to counter them.
You can adapt to compete against almost any kind of opponent.

## INSECTOIDS

### Physical Traits

Partial vestigal exoskeleton, male prefers a forward leaning orientation for
faster mobility, female grows a whiplike sexual organ after initial mating.

### Social Traits

Generally antisocial and cranky. Not invited to attend many gatherings
because of a superfluous organ that sporadically vents an opaque gas which
tarnishes silver and acts as a depilatory.

21-4    R AC ECR EATI O N

### Primary Diet

Cellulose and Spackle.

Best Universe/Game Size
Large or better universe. You’ll need time to increase your population size and
develop powerful weapons.

### Advantages

Immune to temperature. Good fighters, with top of the line warships and
superior battle initiative. Cheap research for energy and weapons. Better than
average with factories. Able to build cheaper starbases. Shields regenerate
during battle.

### Disadvantages

Need to find planets with gravity and radiation on the further ends of the
spectrum. Limited to a few types of armor and even those are at fi strength.
Engine technology is sometimes unreliable. Has no chance to build freighter
transport routes cheaply. Terraforming research is expensive.

### Strategies

Your best chance is probably to out-produce and aggressively attack your
opponents. Build fast warships and colonizers. You colonize slowly so build
remote miners and search for nearby planets with plentiful mineral contents.
Be aggressive with your neighbors, and their neighbors: what you can’t
colonize, take away.

## NUCLEOTIDS

### Physical Traits

Resembles a scaly tree stump with attractive legs but far too many eyes. 12
types of glands discharge seasonal fluids for various hygenic and nutritional
needs.

### Social Traits

Gregarious but quick to take offense. As hard as it may be to resist, don’t stick
your fingers in their ooze holes. Always ask for a sample first.

PREDEFINED RACES   21-5

### Primary Diet

Anything burnt or injected with a summer discharge also used externally to
accelerate tanning.

Best Universe/Game Size
Medium to large universe. This will give them time to grow and develop
technology before encountering other races.

### Advantages

Can live on almost any planet. Excellent at robotic mining. Good at fighting
and building starbases. Able to sneak up on opponents and steal valuable
minerals.

### Disadvantages

Very low growth rate. Below average in building and using factories and
mines. Abysmal at performing research.

### Strategies

Expand as fast as your population growth will let you. Avoid conflict for as
long as possible. Concentrate on expansion.

## RABBITOIDS

### Physical Traits

Similiar to humans except for that thing.

### Social Traits

Swingers of the stars. A fast growing, generally peaceful race.

### Primary Diet

That thing. They break it off, consume it then grow another. Nobody has ever
seen them eat anything else.

21-6    RAC E CR EATI ON

Best Universe Size/Game Difficulty
Has the potential to do well in any size of universe.

### Advantages

None of the other pre-made races grow faster (only the humanoids come
close). Wide habitability range, as well as the ability to eventually terraform
each environmental variable up to 30% makes proliferation highly likely.
Although you are average at how many resources you create per person, your
high growth rate will help increase the rate at which you create resources.

They are efficient with factories and terraforming planets. They start with Tech
5 in propulsion and construction giving them high speed engines and
advanced hulls at the start of the game. In larger games their superior stargate
technology gives them a definite edge in fleet deployment.

### Disadvantages

Slightly below average miners. Unable to build penetrating scanners.

### Strategies

Breed, breed, breed. With your habitable range, and terraforming advantages, you can inhabit a large portion of the universe.

## SILICANOIDS

### Physical Traits

Silicanoids resemble slow moving stacks of thousands of intricately oriented
quartz scales that randomly shift and slide past one another as they submerge
and surface within the body. When hurrying, Silicanoids produce a sound like
metal rakes being drawn over rusted metal and leave a prismatic cloud of
microfine sand in their wake.

### Social Traits

Abrasive by nature, immune to all environmental factors, can populate any
planet, slow growing, slow to research. Planets are a common commodity for
this race. If you lose a few, it won’t matter, because you can live anywhere.

PREDEFINED RACES   21-7

### Primary Diet

Grits.

Best Universe Size/Game Difficulty
Does better in a medium universe, even better in a large to huge universe, at
any level of game.

### Advantages

Immune to all environmental attributes, which means you can colonize any
planet. Produces resources quickly. Has access to additional ram scoop
engines. All engines use less fuel. The ultra flexible and powerful Metamorph
hull is available only to your race.

### Disadvantages

Low growth rate, which means you can’t colonize at too fast of a rate. Poor
research hampers a quick and explosive start.

### Strategies

Don’t waste your time on scouts. Build mini-colony ships, fill them up, and
colonize all the planets you find (make sure to colonize the more mineral-rich
planets first). Don’t pull people off planets faster than you can grow them, though. Otherwise you’ll have thinly populated worlds ripe for takeover.

If the universe is large, you’ll have many planets colonized by the time you
encounter your opponents.

No need for remote mining, since you can colonize anything.

Auto-build factories, then mines, then factories, until you find a better
production strategy.

Build starbases whenever you have enough resources.

Build big bombers to clear your opponent’s planets.

Build defensive fleets and park them near your starbases, holding off bombing
raids by AIs.

22               ALTERNATE REALITY RACES

Although Alternate Reality is really a primary trait, it’s responsible for races so
unusual it deserves its own chapter.

## POPULATION AND GROWTH

Alternate Reality races are highly developed energy-based life forms. Their
bodies are fragile, flattening like paper under any but the lightest gravitational
conditions. As a result they have adapted to living in starbases instead, controlling their planets from orbit. Their growth rates are still determined by
the planet’s value as these numbers indicate their tolerance to such factors as
solar radiation and planetary gravity wells. Their maximum population per
planet is determined by the starbase size. This ranges from 250,000 for starter
colonies to 3,000,000 for their Death Star. Living on the starbase has a
downside: if the starbase is destroyed, the population goes with it.

## SCANNERS

Alternate Reality colonists perform scanning duty from the starbase. They
distance they scan is determined by the following formula:
Scanning Distance = SQRT(Population / 10)

### The Ultra Station and Death Star come with equipment that allows the

colonists to also perform penetrating scans at half that distance as long as you
don’t select the No Advanced Scanners trait when defining the race.

FACTORIES                                                                             The Efficiency Co-

SQRT(Population x Energy_Tech_Level / Efficiency_Coefficient)

22-2    RAC E CR EATI ON

## MINING

These folks can’t build mines. Using energy powers alone, they can do a
limited amount of mining equal to this formula:
Mining = SQRT(Population/10)
However, since they don’t actually inhabit the planet, there is nothing to stop
them from remote mining worlds they own as well as uncolonized worlds.

## DEFENSES

Likewise, they can’t build defenses. Since they live and die with their starbase, defenses don’t have any meaning to them. People can’t bomb Alternate
Reality planets, and mineral packets flung from other planets don’t kill
Alternate Reality colonists.
The best defenses are advanced armor and weapons for the starbases, and
minefields.

## STARBASES

Starbases costs Alternators 20% less than other races (though this is not
cumulative with advantages provided by the Improved Starbases trait). They
are also able to build the Death Star, the biggest, baddest thing in the sky.

## COLONIZATION

Alternators can’t build normal colonization modules. They must build the
more expensive Orbital Colonization modules capable of deploying as an
Orbital Fort at the target world. This module can be mounted only on the
colonizer hull. The hull is also capable of limited bombing to get rid of any
pesky enemy startup colonies. An Orbital Colonization module can kill 2000
enemy colonists each year that it bombs.
There is a cost for traveling to other worlds. Interstellar travel kills 3% of any
colonists in the fleet per year.
Alternators cannot drop colonists on worlds in order to take them over (no
ground combat).

23               THE GUTS OF COMBAT

Here’s some information to help you understand the behavior of fleets in
battle. You may find it useful in planning battle strategies. It may also help
satisfy your drive to collect Stars! military trivia.

## ABOUT THE BATTLE BOARD

The battle board is the grid you see in the Battle VCR. The fleets are
distributed on the board as tokens. Each token is a stack of identical ships
from a single fleet. The individual tokens move around the board targeting
enemy tokens, following the tactics specified in their battle plan. Each
location can contain any number of tokens.

Battles last up to 16 rounds. One round of battle is each token getting a
chance to move and fire. A round is broken into phases, where one phase is a
single token moving or firing.

Each round has three parts:

First, all tokens target an enemy token that best meets their battle plan criteria.

Second, all ships move, in order from heaviest to lightest. Ships’weights are
randomly adjusted by up to 15% each turn, giving ships that are nearly
identical a chance to alternate going first. All ships that can move three
squares this round move one square first, then all ships that can move two
squares move one square, then all ships that can move at least one square
move a square.

Third, weapons fire, in order from highest initiative to lowest.

ARMOR, SHIELDS AND DAMAGE

### Read this section with the following section on Weapon Properties for a fuller

understanding of how armor, shields and specific weapon types interact in
Stars!.

### Armor and Shields

Hulls have a base armor value. Additional armor is added to this value.

Shields will take damage and fail before enemy weapons attack your armor. In
a token the shields overlap. For example, if your fleet has 20 scouts with
shields valued at 20 each, you have a pool of 400 shields points that must be
destroyed before the armor on any of those ships is damaged—unless your
opponent is using torpedoes. Torpedoes damage both shields and armor, taking shield points and armor points from the token with each successful
attack..

Shields are at full strength at the start of each battle. This means if you leave a
battle one turn and enter a battle the next turn, your shields will be back at
full strength. If you have the Regenerating Shields trait then your shields will
regenerate 10% of their base value at the start of every round.

### If you are using beam weapons and the damage your token can inflict on an

enemy’s token is more than enough to destroy the enemy token, the
remainder is used on additional enemy tokens in the same location, limited
only by the number of ships in the attacking token.

For example, one token does a total of 1000 dp of beam weapon damage.
The primary target is destroyed after taking 500 damage. If there are 10 other
tokens at the same location, each consisting of a single ship with 150 dp of
armor, three tokens would be destroyed and one would take 33% damage.

If those 10 tokens had been a single token of 10 ships they would have still
lost three ships, but each of the remaining seven ships would have taken less
than 5% damage. If the ships had 100 dp armor and 50 dp shields each, then
stacked together the shields would have absorbed all 500dp and no ships
would have been lost. No combination of shields and armor would have
saved those three ships with each ship in a separate token.

THE G UT SOF CO MB AT   23-3

### Damage

Damage is applied as follows: If the damage applied to a token’s armor
exceeds the remaining armor of one or more of the ships in the token, then
those ships are destroyed. Any remaining damage is spread over the ENTIRE
token, with the damage being divided up equally among the remaining ships.

A separate damage value is stored for each token in the battle. Stars! stores
the percentage of ships in the token that are damaged, along with the
percentage of damage to each ship.

Damage is displayed as C @ P%, where C is the count of damaged tokens in
a fleet and P is the percentage of damage inflicted. For example, 10@33%
says that 10 tokens are one-third damaged.

For the type of damage inflicted by beam weapons and torpedoes, read the
following description of Weapons and Battle Devices.

## WEAPONS AND BATTLE DEVICES

Read this section with the preceding section on Armor, Shields and Damage
for a fuller understanding of how armor, shields and specific weapon types
interact in Stars!.

### Weapons and Starbases

All weapons mounted on Starbases get a +1 added to their range.

### Beam Weapons

Beam weapons always hit their target, but decay in strength at a rate of 10%
pro-rated over their maximum range. For example, a weapon that will do 100
dp to a target in the same square and has a maximum range of 3 will only do
94 dp to a target two squares away. All damage from beam weapons is
applied to shields first. Any damage not absorbed by the shields is applied to
armor.

### If an attacking token has more than one ship and its beam weapon strike

destroys the target token, then the remaining damage is applied to other
tokens in range. The maximum number of tokens targeted is the number of
ships in the attacking token.

23-4   THE GU TSO F ST AR S !

### The following beam weapon information is provided for comparison

purposes. See the Beam Weapons section of the Technology Browser for the
exact statistics of a specific weapon.

### Normal Beam Weapons

Damage: From 10 to 430 damage points
Range: From 1 to 3 squares
Initiative: From 5 to 9

Range 0 Weapons
Damage: From 90 to 600 damage points
Range: Same square only
Initiative: 10 to 11

### Gattling Weapons

Damage: From 13 to 200 damage points
Range: 2 squares
Initiative: 12 to 13

### These are extremely powerful weapons that hit every enemy token in their

range each time they fire. They also sweep minefields as if they were range 4.

### Shield Sappers

Damage: From 82 to 541 damage points
Range: 3
Initiative: 14

### These medium range weapons are very powerful but are only useful against

shields. They have no effect on armor. They do have a higher initiative than
any other weapon. This means that they will take out the enemy shields
before your other weapons fire.

Shield Sappers cannot perform minesweeping.

### Minesweeping

Each beam weapon automatically sweep up to (Damage x Range x Range)
mines per year.

### Torpedoes

Each torpedo fired has a chance of missing. For example: If a token has two
ships, each with a weapon slot holding two normal torpedoes, then a single
shot fires all four torpedoes. Each torpedo has a chance to hit or miss

T HE G UT SOF C O MB AT       23-5

according to its accuracy value. Normal torpedoes have an accuracy of 75%, which means that it is likely that three of the four torpedoes would hit.
Torpedo accuracy can be improved using Battle Computers. Jammers can
decrease the accuracy of enemy torpedoes.

### Torpedoes that hit their primary target apply half of their damage directly to

the armor of the target token. The other half of the damage is applied to the
shields. Any damage that isn’t absorbed by the shields is applied to the armor.

### The maximum number of ships that can be killed by a torpedo strike is the

number of torpedoes that hit. So in the preceding example the strike can kill
up to 3 ships. If the target token has one ship in it and the hits caused more
damage than was necessary to destroy it, then the damage is applied to other
tokens in the same square. This type of damage is applied first to the shields;
any damage not absorbed by the shields is applied to the armor. In no case
can the number of ships destroyed exceed the number of torpedoes that hit.

Torpedoes that miss do collateral damage to the target token only. Collateral
damage is 1/8th of the normal damage of the torpedo and works much like a
Shield Buster beam weapon. In other words it only affects shields.

The following torpedo information is provided for comparison purposes. See
the Torpedoes section of the Technology Browser for the exact statistics of a
specific weapon.

### Normal Torpedoes

Damage: From 5 to 300 damage points
Range: From 4 to 5 squares
Initiative: from 0 to 4
Accuracy: 35% to 80%

### Capital Ship Missiles

Damage: From 85 to 525 damage points
Range: From 5 to 6 squares
Initiative: From 0 to 3
Accuracy: 20% to 30%

### These powerful torpedoes do more damage than normal torpedoes and have a          Capital ship

longer range than any other weapon. Due to their poor accuracy and the fact       missiles do twice
that a single torpedo can take out at most one enemy ship, these missiles are     the stated damage if
the enemy ship has
best mounted on starbases and battleships with a lot of Battle Computers.         no remaining
Their ideal use is against large ships and starbases.                             shields.

### Jammers

Jammers decrease torpedo accuracy. The Jammer 10 and 50 are available to        See the Electrical
Inner Strength players only. Jammer strength is additive. For example, a ship   section of the

with three 20% Jammers reduces a normal torpedo’s 75% accuracy by 20%           Browser for a
three times:                                                                    descriptions of each
Jammer.
75 x .8 x .8 x .8 = 38% torpedo accuracy

### Battle Computers

These devices increase the initiative of all weapons on the ship. The three
different devices range from +1 to +3 initiative. They also decrease torpedo
inaccuracy by 20 to 50%.

### Decreasing the inaccuracy of a torpedo by a percentage is not the same as

increasing the accuracy by that percentage. As torpedo accuracy becomes
higher it becomes harder to improve it.

Computing the effects of a battle computer:

Example 1: A normal 75% accurate torpedo fired using a 50% battle
computer.
Incorrect calculation: 75% x 1.5 = 112% accuracy.
Correct calculation: 100 - ((100 - 75) x .5) = 88% accuracy.
Example 2: A normal torpedo’s 75% accuracy is modified by two 30%
battle computers by decreasing its inaccuracy 30% twice.
100 - ((100 - 75) x .7 x .7) = %88 torpedo accuracy.

### If the attacking token has battle computers and the target has jammers the

devices cancel each other out on a 1% to 1% basis.

Examples:

Target token has Jammers totaling a 50% decrease in accuracy. Attacker’s
battle computers add up to a 45% decrease in inaccuracy. Result: 5%
decrease in accuracy.
Target token has Jammers totaling a 30% decrease in accuracy. Attacker’s
battle computers add up to a 40% decrease in inaccuracy. Result: 10%
decrease in inaccuracy.

### Energy Dampener

This device slows down ALL ships in the entire battle board by 1 square of
movement per round, for the duration of the battle. This is true even if the
ship carrying the Dampener is destroyed before the end of the battle (the
device has a lasting affect). The effect is not additive, so there is no advantage
or penalty for having more than one Dampener in a battle.

### Capacitors

Increase the damage caused by all beam weapons on board by a percentage.
Capacitor values run from 10% to 20%. The maximum additional percentage
increase in damage caused by multiple capacitors is 250%.

In this example, a ship has a beam weapon capable of 100 damage and three
10% capacitors:

100dp x 1.1 x 1.1 x 1.1 = 133dp

## DAMAGE REPAIR

### If after a battle your fleet has one or more ship types listed in red in the Fleet

Composition tile, then you have taken damage. Click on a red ship name to
display how much damage has been done.

Ship repair restores the armor value at an annual rate based on the ship’s
location:

Stopped or orbiting, with at least one Fuel           additional 5%

### Transport hull in the fleet

Stopped or orbiting, with at least one Super          additional 10%

### Fuel Xport hull in the fleet

For example, a ship with a base of 25 damage points (dp) plus armor with a
value of 75 dp has a maximum armor value of 100 dp. It takes 10 dp of
damage, it would take 2 years in deep space, or one year in orbit, to fully
repair the armor.

If you’re orbiting an opponent’s planet and your fleet has Attack orders, repairs will not happen. Repairs also do not happen during the year a fleet is
using a stargate.

During the years the starbase is under attack, the fleet will be repaired as if
the starbase was not present.

Fuel Transport/XPort Hull Advantage

### Notice that the table shows an advantage of using the Fuel Transport and

Xport hulls: they repair other ships in the fleet, as well as collecting fuel. You
only need one Fuel Transport hull in the fleet to gain the 5% increase in the
repair rate, or one Super Fuel Xport to see a 10% increase. Adding extra
Transport or Xport hulls doesn’t increase the rate. And you always see the gain
provided by the more advanced hull. Thus, if you have both Fuel Transport
and Super Fuel Xport hulls in the same fleet, you gain only the 10% increase
provided by the Super Fuel Xport hull.

### Starbase Repair

For ordinary players, starbases are repaired at a rate of 10% a year. For
players with the Inner Strength race trait, starbases are repaired at 15% a year.

MOVEMENT, INITIATIVE AND FIRING IN BATTLE

### Movement

Movement is always between     and 2          squares per round. The distance a
ship can move per round is computed in         squares, using the following
formula:

T HE G UT SOF CO MB AT       23- 9

### The Formula for Movement

### Movement in Squares per Round                                                    before any addition

or subtraction.

2              3   2   3   2   3    2   3   2

### Order of Movement

Movement happens in three phases:

Phase 1: All tokens that can move 3 squares this round get to move 1 square.

Phase 2: All tokens that can move 2 or more squares this round get to move 1
square.

Phase 3: All tokens that can move this round get to move 1 square.

In each phase tokens move in order from heaviest to lightest, with a margin of
+     - 15%.

### Each token attempts to find the best square to move into that matches the

tactic they’ve been assigned. For example, you have selected Maximize Net
Damage and have a ship with a combination of range 1 and 2 weapons. Your
enemy has a ship with a combination of range 1 and 2 weapons also, but

23-10    THE G UTS O F ST ARS !

their range 1 weapons are much better than yours. You will stay at range 2
because that is where you will do the highest net damage.

Overthrusters, Maneuvering Jets and Movement

Multiple Overthrusters and Maneuvering Jets are additive. One Overthruster
gives the token a speed bonus of   square of movement per round, with
each extra Overthruster adding   square.

### A Maneuvering Jet gives the token an extra    square of movement per round

of battle, with each extra Jet adding square.

Maximum movement is 2      squares per round, regardless of how many
Overthrusters and Maneuvering Jets the design may have.

### Firing

Weapons fire in order from highest to lowest initiative. Weapons fire on a
weapon slot-by-weapon slot basis, the shortest range weapons of a given
initiative firing first. If the target token is destroyed, damage will stream over
to other tokens in range.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the firing order in battle. All ships have an innate hull
initiative value, ranging from 0 to 18. Each battle computer increases initiative
by 1, 2 or 3 points. Firing initiative is the sum of the hull initiative, battle
computers, race modifiers (if you have the War Monger trait) and the
weapon’s initiative.

Highest initiative fires first. If a ship has a base initiative of 11 and beam
weapons with an initiative of 5 for a total initiative of 16, and a second ship
has a base initiative of 14 and a torpedo weapon with an initiative of 3 for a
total initiative of 17, the second ship fires first. If the torpedo ship also had a
second weapon with an initiative of 1 then the torpedo would fire first, the
other ship’s beams would fire, followed by the torpedo ship’s second weapon.

24                 THE GUTS OF CLOAKING

In order for matter to be cloaked, it requires a certain number of cloaking units
per kT. When a ship is empty, its cloak provides the maximum amount of
cloaking possible with that device. When the ship has cargo, the weight of the
cargo reduces the number of cloak units per kT, and thus, the cloaking
percentage.

## CLOAKING WHEN THE SHIP IS EMPTY

To determine the total number of cloaking units for an unladen ship, read the
following table:

Cloaking Device                   Cloak Units/kT            Max Cloaking %
Transport Cloak*                  300                       75
Stealth Cloak                     70                        35
Super-Stealth Cloak               140                       55
Ultra-Stealth Cloak*              540                       85                      Cloaks marked here
with an * are
Shadow Shield*                    70                        35                      available only to
Super Stealth races.
Depleted Neutronium Armor*        50                        25
Chameleon Scanner*                40                        20

For example, an empty ship with a Stealth Cloak has 70 cloak units/kT, or 35%
cloaking. By itself, the ship is visible to enemy scanners at only 35% of their
maximum range.

When a cloaked ship has cargo, we need to recalculate the number of cloak
units/kT available. Let’s say this ship is a small freighter with a Quick Jump 5
engine, Tritanium Armor, and a Stealth Cloak. Empty, it weighs 91kT, with 70

freighter with cargo, it weighs 161kT. To calculate the new cloaking
percentage:
1. Calculate the total number of cloaking units for the ship:
Max_cloak_units/kT x Ship_mass_empty.
Example: 70 units/kT x 91kT = 6370 total cloak units
2. Calculate the actual units/kT:
Total_units / Ship_mass_with_cargo
Example: 6370 / 161 kT = ~40 units/kT

### Use the following chart to learn how much coverage a given number of

cloaking units provides.

At 40 cloak units/kT, the loaded freighter in our example is now only 20%
cloaked. The following table provides exact numbers at certain points on the
graph, allowing for more precise calculations.

100 units/kT             50% cloaked

300 units/kT             75% cloaked

600 units/kT             87.5% cloaked

## THE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE TACHYON DETECTORS

When a hull has more than one Tachyon Detector in its design, the
effectiveness is calculated as follows:

25               THE GUTS OF MASS DRIVERS

## DAMAGE POTENTIAL OF MINERAL PACKETS

### So you always wondered exactly what sort of damage a mineral packet was

capable of doing? Here’s the scoop on mass packets.

Mineral packets can be flung at speeds from Warp 5 to 3 Warp levels above
the driver’s rated speed. Exceeding the rated speed will form unstable packets
that will disintegrate and lose minerals as they travel. Thus, with a top of the
line Warp 13 mass accelerator, you can fling packets at speeds up to Warp
16. Why would you want to fling packets slower than the rated speed? Simple:
the planet you are sending packets to doesn’t have an driver capable of
catching the faster packets and you don’t want to kill off your own colonists.

### If you have the

PACKET DECAY RATE                                                                  Interstellar Traveler
trait, packets flung
Packets thrown over the rated speed of the mass driver decay as follows:           at or below the

rate; as is the
minimum decay.

## SPEED AND DISTANCE

### Warp N means that something traveling at that speed will cover N x N light

years per year. Thus, a Warp 16 packet will travel 256 light years each turn!

25-2     TH E G UT S OF S TAR S !

## DAMAGE AND RECOVERY FORMULAS AND CALCULATION

When a packet hits a planet without a mass driver, or with a mass driver rated
beneath the speed of the incoming packet, damage will be done. Damage is
determined by the speed of the packet, not the rating of the driver sending the
packet. For example, if a Warp 5 driver flings a packet at Warp 8 to another
Warp 5 driver, damage will be done to the receiver.

### Speed

spdPacket = Packet Warp ^ 2
spdReceiver = Rcvr Accel ^ 2

### Percent Caught Safely

The percentage of the packet recovered intact.
%CaughtSafely = spdReceiver / spdPacket

### Minerals Recovered

The receiver recovers 1/3 of the portion not caught safely.
(packetkT x %CaughtSafely + packetkT x %remaining x 1/3)

### Raw Damage

dmgRaw = (spdPacket - spdReceiver) x wtPacket / 160

### Raw Damage modified by planetary defenses

dmgRaw2 = dmgRaw x (100% - pctDefCoverage)

### Colonists Killed

The number colonists killed is the larger (maximum) of the following:
dmgRaw2 x Population / 1000
dmgRaw2 x 100

### Planetary Defenses Destroyed
#destroyed = #defenses x dmgRaw2 / 1000
If #destroyed is less than dmgRaw2 / 20, then it is that number.

### Interstellar Traveller Trait Affects Catching Packets

Races with the Interstellar trait are only 1/2 as effective at catching packets. To
calculate the damage taken, divide speed_received by two.

T HE GU TSO F MASS D RI VER S      25-3

### Example

You fling a 1000kT packet at Warp 10 at a planet with a Warp 5 driver, a
population of 250,000 and 50 defenses preventing 60% of incoming damage.
spdPacket = 100
spdReceiver = 25
%CaughtSafely = 25%
minerals recovered = 1000kT x 25% + 1000kT x 75% x 1/3 = 250 + 250 = 500kT
dmgRaw = 75 x 1000 / 160 = 469
dmgRaw2 = 469 x 40% = 188
#colonists killed = Max. of ( 188 x 250,000 / 1000, 188 x 100)
= Max. of ( 47,000, 18800) = 47,000 colonists
#defenses destroyed = 50 * 188 / 1000 = 9 (rounded down)
If, however, the receiving planet had no mass driver or defenses, the damage
is far greater:
minerals recovered = 1000kT x 0% + 1000kT x 100% x 1/3 = only 333kT
dmgRaw = 100 x 1000 / 160 = 625
dmgRaw2 = 625 x 100% = 625
#colonists killed = Max. of (625 x 250,000 / 1000, 625 x 100)
= Max. of (156,250, 62500) = 156,250.
If the packet increased speed up to Warp 13, then:
dmgRaw2 = dmgRaw = 169 x 1000 / 160 = 1056
#colonists killed = Max. of (1056 x 250,000 / 1000, 1056 x 100)               Learn more about

26                  THE GUTS OF MINEFIELDS

## TYPES OF MINES

### Normal

Effect: Blows up.
Maximum safe speed: Warp 4
Damage/ship: 100 (125 for ramscoops) for each engine
Minimum fleet damage: 500 points (600 for ramscoops)
Probability of hitting one: 0.3% per light year traveled for each warp over the safe
speed.
Example: A fleet traveling Warp 9 has a 1.5% chance per light year traveled in a turn.
Traveling 10 light years through the minefield that turn, the fleet has a 10.5% chance
of triggering a mine.

### Heavy

Effect: Blows up.
Maximum safe speed: Warp 6
Damage/ship: 500 (600 for ramscoops)
Minimum fleet damage points: 2000 (2500 for ramscoops)
Probability of hitting one: 1% per light year traveled for each warp over the safe speed.
Example: A fleet traveling Warp 9 has a 3% chance per light year traveled in a turn.
Traveling 10 light years through the minefield that turn, the fleet has a 30% chance of
triggering a mine.

26-6    T HE GUT SOF STARS !

### Speed Trap

Effect: Halts the fleet, does no damage.
Maximum safe speed: Warp 5
Damage/ship: none
Minimum fleet damage: none
Probability of hitting one: 3% per light year traveled for each warp over the safe speed.
Example: A fleet traveling Warp 9 has a 15% chance per light year traveled in a turn.
Traveling 10 light years through the minefield that turn, the fleet is going to trigger a
mine.

## DETECTING MINEFIELDS

### Cloaked value of minefields

Penetrating Scanners: 0%
Non-Penetrating Scanners: 75%

Conditions for detecting an opponent’s minefield
You can see both the center and radius of an opponent’s minefields if:
- the center of the minefield is in range of your penetrating scanner, OR
- You have hit the minefield at least once and the center is in range of your
normal scanners OR
- You are IN the mine field.

## SHIP CLOAK EFFECTIVENESS IN MINEFIELDS

When a ship is in a minefield, and the mines are acting as scanners, the ship’s cloak
effectiveness is always an absolute value (90% cloak = 10% chance of detection).
Only races with the Space Demolition trait can use minesfields as (non-penetrating)
scanners.

## RACE TRAITS AND MINEFIELDS

### Special Capabilities

For Space demolition races, minefields act as normal scanners but do not detect fleets
orbiting planets.

HOST FILE — GAMENAME.HST

### This is the file containing the information the host program needs for a

specific game. This file should be available only to the person playing the
host.

UNIVERSE FILE — GAMENAME.XY
This is the universe file, containing information about the positions of all the
planets. It does not change over the course of the game. Individual players as
well as the host program need to have this file available to them.

TURN FILE — GAMENAME.MN
These are the turn files. N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the player
number. This is the individual file for each player, containing all the data
about that player’s race and state of the player’s empire at the beginning of a
turn.

RACE DESCRIPTION FILE — NAME.RN FILES

### This file contains a race description created and saved using the Custom Race

Wizard. N can be any number (you can actually use any extension, the
default is r1.) You can specify a race file for each non-computer player in the    The extension of .r1

C-2     BAC KOF THE BOO K

LOG FILE —- GAMENAME.XN
These are the log files. N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the player
number. This is the log of orders given by a player for the current turn. This
file is submitted, either automatically or manually, to the host program. The
host adds the changes to the player’s .mN file, and returns that file to the
player when the new turn is generated. The host needs these files to update
the information about each player from the .hst file before turn generation.

Each time the player opens (or continues) a game, the .mN file is loaded. If a
corresponding log file exists, it will also be loaded to update the game’s
current state.

HISTORY FILE —- GAMENAME.HN
These are history files. N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the player
number. This file is created by the player as he sees universe data. It is a
history of the things the player has seen or learned on previous turns.
Typically, only the player maintains a copy of this file. If a player will be
absent for a few turns, and wishes to be temporarily replaced by the
Housekeeper AI, a copy of this file should be given to the host so the absent
player’s view of the universe can be updated.

If this file is lost, corrupted or moved to another directory, the player will not
see what’s been done in past turns.

INI FILE — STARS.INI
The stars.ini file is located in the windows directory. Stars! stores player
options and current game information in this file. Most of the items in the file
have to do with relatively unimportant stuff like the arrangement and
windows, the current scanner view and overlays.

The following items in the stars.ini are user changeable:

### Default Password

Set the password in the [Misc] section of stars.ini:

DefaultPassword=Foo
Where Foo is whatever password you generally use. If you are sure that your
opponents will not have access to your stars.ini file you can set this to your

FILES USE D IN STA RS !            C-3

password. Whenever you open a game file that is protected by this password
you will not be prompted to enter it.

### Number of Backup Directories

Set this option in the [Misc] section of stars.ini:

Backups=N
Where N is a number between 1 and 999. Backup directories will be named
Backup1 to BackupN and old game files will be stored there according to the
turn number. For example with backups=4 then the first turn would be backed
up to the directory backup1, the second to backup2, the third to backup3, the
fourth to backup4, the fifth to backup1 and so on.

By default Stars! saves one previous turn’s data in a directory it creates named
Backup.

## D                FREQUENTLY ASKED

QUESTIONS
IS ANYONE OUT THERE?

Do the AIs (computer players) cheat?

Stars! is one of the few games where computer players do not cheat. The
Stars! AIs are governed by the same code that governs human players, and
receive the same information. Expert level AIs start with more race design
advantage points than human players —that is the only difference. If you feel
like you've been taken advantage of by an AI, let us know. We'll investigate
and, if we find that the AI does have an unfair advantage, we'll take it behind
the woodshed.

Will anyone listen if I have feedback for the authors?

### IIf you didn't like something in particular or experience problems with the

game, or if you have good ideas for the game, please let us know. We answer
all our mail and value your feedback -- if it's something we can help you
with, we will. If it's just a matter of not having a feature you want, let us know
that, too -- it just might show up in the next version.

When you submit your ideas, please keep in mind that Stars! is turn-based, not real-time.

How do I get player and technical support?

If you haven't used the tutorial, you should take a run through it. You can
learn a lot about game play there even if you aren't just starting out. The
online player's guide (help) contains detailed documentation about virtually

D-2      BAC KOF THE B O OK

every aspect of the game.

If these resources don't yield answers to your questions, you can send e-mail
to support@webmap.com, or visit these web pages:

UK: http://www.empire.co.uk/support/support.htm

US: http://www.empire-us.com/support/support.htm

How do I submit bug reports?
1. Write a description of the suspected bug in a text file.
2. Zip all the relevant game files and the text file:

pkzip gamename.zip gamename.* backup\gamename.* bugnotefile
3. Send us the zip file in one of the following ways:

Mail the zip file to bugstars@webmap.com along with a description of the

FTP the zip file to beast.webmap.com/pub. Be sure to send e-mail to
bugstars@webmap.com with a description of the problem and the name
of the zip file uploaded.
We appreciate the time and effort it takes to send these files. It helps us a
great deal to have the actual game files when trying to determine if a bug
exists. Thanks for taking the time to help Stars! maintain it's reputation as one
of the most stable and bug-free games on the market.

When I zip my game files, they don't get any smaller. Why not?

Stars! game files are already compressed.

## DIFFERENT STROKES

Can several people play on the same computer using one copy?

Yes. Up to 16 people can play "hot-seat" on the same computer with one
copy of Stars!. Just make sure that all players use the same copy. In other
words make sure that there is only one copy of the game running.

To play one game with several players on one machine:

FRE Q UE NT LY ASK ED Q U EST IO NS           D-3

METHOD 1

Each player can submit their turn, saves, and then goes back to the splash
screen using File (Close). You don't have to exit Stars! between players.

METHOD 2

If you have enough memory (about 2-4MB per player depending on the
universe size) you can run multiple instances of the game. An "instance" is
one running session of the game.

For Setup and Play details, see Chapter 2, Multi-Player Setup.

Can two or more people using the same machine, submit turns in the same
e-mail game?

Yes. When your .x# file is created it is marked with both your serial number

and a fingerprint of your machine. The host will only penalize two or more
people playing with the same serial number and DIFFERENT machine
fingerprints. Any number of people can submit turns from the same machine
with the same serial number. If however, you had two machines at home and
submitted one .x# file from each, then each one must have a unique serial

number. This allows you to do cool things like take a friend's turn for them
when they're out of town or have two family members play from the same
machine and so on. We have tried to make sure that our copy protection
mechanism is as non-intrusive as possible.

Where can I find hosted games and other players?

WWW Host Sites:

Visit the Stars! website at http://www.webmap.com/stars!. You’ll find a
waypoints page which lists a number of Stars! sites where you can join games
and find player resources.                                                     Learn about:

A HOST’S WORK IS NEVER DONE

Is it possible to Host Stars! in DOS?

FR EQ U EN TLY AS K ED QU EST I O NS            D-4

It depends. If the machine cannot run Windows, then the answer is No. If the
machine can run Windows but usually does not, then the answer is Yes. It is
possible to launch Windows and Stars! from a DOS batch file in such a way
that Stars! will generate turns for one or more games and then exit all the way
out of Windows allowing the batch file to continue where you it left off.

Why is there any way for a host to retrieve a lost password?

### Any utility which allowed hosts to remove or change passwords would

remove all security from the game. All an unscrupulous host would have to
do is copy the game files to another directory and remove the passwords from
the player's files in that directory. They could then look at everybody's data in
that copy of the universe and no matter what Stars! did, the real players
would never know. In a network game ANY player could pull the same trick.
Security is an all or nothing element. If we didn't provide at least the minimal
level of security we do now, multi-player Stars! games would be a joke.

I have multiple licenses. How do I restore a turn ruined by installing the
wrong serial number on a machine?

### All you have to do is copy the game files from the backup directory to the

game directory, open each affected player's turn and choose File (Save). This
will save their .x# files with the correct serial numbers and machine IDs.

## RACE DESIGN

How do I create and save a custom race?

Read Chapter 20 on Designing Custom Races.

Is there an ultimate race?

### It depends on the type of universe and the placement and experience of the

other players. Expert players can make any race an ultimate race (a few
people have proven this). However, the same "ultimate race" in that game
might get stomped into space dust in another game with a less hospitable mix
of variables. Success breeds predictability.

Can I edit a race during play?

Once a game is started, you're stuck with the race you entered the game with.

FR EQ UE NT LY ASK ED QU EST IO NS   D-5

### All game files are compressed and encrypted to provide security for all

players. Players cannot read or modify data files.

You can however, at any time, open a saved race file (including the file for a
race currently in play) and make edits. As you are playing a race, you might
discover a weakness you would like to correct for the next time you play that
race.

To edit a race, open the race file using the File (Open) menu item. Read
Chapter 20 on Designing Custom Races for more information.

WHILE I’M PLAYING

Can I design my own ship hulls?

You can design elaborate ship configurations, but you can't design your own
hulls. This is a primary game-balancing restriction.

Can I use diplomacy in Stars!?

### Stars! has features that allow you to practice simple diplomacy in multi-player

games.

Use the Message pane to communicate with other players, arranging such
things as alliances, rendezvous, trade agreements and non-aggression pacts.

When you're setting up the game, you can specify winning conditions that
encourage diplomacy by allowing for multiple winners. Stars! does not
require one winner.

You can declare neutral and friendly players using the Player Relations dialog.

### This prevents you from attacking the wrong people and allows you to

automatically come to a friend's aid if they're under fire. Friends can also pass
through each other's mine fields without harm. So it's worth while to set up
alliances, even if they're temporary.

How can I print out a star chart of the universe?

Use the File ( Print Map) menu item.

### ADDED COST OF RESEARCH

The added cost of research represents the cost of such things as
dilution of research efforts across more than one field, ramp up time
to switch to entering a new fields of study, etc.

AI
An AI is a computer player. AIs always exist in single player games
and can exist in multi-player games, if chosen.

## AIS AND ADVANTAGE POINTS

### The easy AIs receive substantially fewer advantage points than you

do. The expert AIs receive more advantage points than you. The
Standard and Hard AIs fall somewhere in between.

## ANNUAL GROWTH RATE

### This rate is calculated by multiplying the habitability value by the

Maximum Colonist Growth Rate Per Year found on page 4 of the
View Race dialog. For races with the Hyper-Expansion trait the actual
maximum colonists growth rate is twice that displayed.

## BATTLE SPEED

In computing movement in battle, the best speed for all engines is the
figure for 120% fuel usage.

GL-2   B ACK O F TH E B OO K

## BEST WARP SPEED

### This is the maximum warp speed that the engines on this ship design

can go at 120% normal fuel consumption or less. For Ramscoop
engines it is the maximum speed the engine can travel withut using
fuel. This number appears in the Fleet Composition tile for the
selected fleet.

This speed appies only to travel between waypoints, not battle.

## CAPITAL SHIP

A ship with a power rating of at least 2000.

## COLLATERAL DAMAGE

Damage taken by shield of targeted ships when torpedoes miss.

## DEFENSES AND INVADING TROOPS

Defense percentage values are based on the installation’s
effectiveness against bombs. Planetary defenses are 75% effective
against invading troops.

## DISENGAGING

The token attempts to get out of battle (jump into hyperspace). It does
not try to leave the square. Eventually, it will simply disappear from
the board. Hopefully this means it has escaped and not been
liberated to its component quarks.

## ENERGY SOURCES FOR STARSHIPS

### Standard starship engines use anti-matter created at starbases while

Ramscoops simply scoop fuel from the surrounding universe

## FACTORY

Factories produce resources. Resources are units of work created by
people and factories for use in production, research and other tasks.

GLO S SAR Y   GL-3

## FIBONACCI SERIES

Fibonacci numbers are the unending sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ... where each term is defined as the sum of its two
predecessors.

## FLEET COLORS

A blue fleet belongs to you. A red fleet belongs to an opponent. A
purple fleet indicates that both your fleet and an opponent’s fleet are
in the same, or nearly the same, location.

## HOST FILE

gamename.hst — This is the file containing the information the host
program needs for a specific game. This file should be available only
to the person playing the host. If the file is password-protected, you
will be asked for a password.

## INITIATIVE

Initiative determines order of firing in battle. The ship with the highest
initiative fires first.

## LOAD OPTIMAL

Transport order. Load no more fuel than you need to reach the next
waypoint. This option can only calculate the amount of fuel required
for one waypoint. It will not attempt to load enough fuel to get you
beyond your next waypoint.

## MAXIMUM SHIP DESIGNS AND SHIPS

16 different ship designs at one time, and up to 32,000 ships of each
design in a fleet.

## MINE

Mines bring minerals to the surface of your planets, where they are
used in production.

GL-4   B ACK O F TH E B OO K

## MINERAL ALCHEMY

You will be able to turn resources into minerals. One instance of
mineral alchemy will use 100 resources to produce one kT of each
mineral - or only 25 resources for players with the Mineral Alchemy
trait. This item will be available in the production inventory and can
be automated through the auto build feature of the production dialog.

## MOVEMENT

Movement is speed in battle ranging from fi square to 2 fi squares per
round.

## ORBIT RING COLORS

A white circle indicates that one or more of your fleets are in orbit. A
red circle indicates one or more of an opponent’s fleets. A purple
circles indicates that both your fleet(s) and an opponent’s fleet(s) are
in orbit.

PLANET-PENETRATING SCANNERS
These scanners can detect fleets in orbit around a planet. They also
can tell you planetary stats from a distance.

## PLAYER LOG FILE

gamename.mN —- N is a number from 1 to 16, representing the
player number. This is the individual file for each player, containing
all the data about that player’s race and state of the player’s empire at
the beginning of a turn. Both the player and the host maintain copies
of this file.

You can load the current turn in a game by opening the .m file which
has your player number in the extension. If the file is password-
protected, you will be asked for a password.

## RACE FILE

name.rN — This file contains a race description created and saved
using the Custom Race wizard. If you open this file from File (Open),

GLO S SAR Y   GL-5

the Custom Race wizard. If the file is password-protected, you will be
asked for a password. The .r extension is not required for a race file, so you may open race files saved using a different extension as well.

## RATING

A ship’s rating is a relative value of its offensive capability. They are
useful only for general comparison of similar ship designs to help you
decide which design might be more effective in battle.

RACE DESCRIPTION FILE — NAME.RN FILES

### This file contains a race description created and saved using the

Custom Race Wizard. N can be any number (you can actually use
any extension, the default is r1.) If you open this file from File (Open), the Custom Race Wizard opens, allowing you to view or change the
race’s attributes.

The extension of .r1 is the default, and is not required.

## RESOURCES

Resources are units of work created by people and factories. They
represent the effort involved in performing a task or producing an
item.

## ROUND OF BATTLE

Battles last up to 16 rounds. One round of battle is each token getting
a chance to move and fire. A round is broken into phases, where one
phase is a single token moving and, if applicable, firing.

## SHIP CLASSES

Unarmed ships — any design that has no weapons and poses no
threat.

Utility ships – unarmed ship that pose a threat (a subset of Unarmed
ships).

Scouts — ships based on the Scout, Super Scout, and Destroyer hulls.

GL-6   B ACK OF TH E BO O K

Warships — all other armed ships, including armed freighters.

Bomber — any ship based on one of the Bomber hulls.

## TOKEN

Each token is a stack of identical ships from a single fleet.
